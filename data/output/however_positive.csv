t3_2rkzen,cngvxsd,I think you are still oversimplifying it. And no you can't just increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of the population. Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you cannot feasibly do this. What if someone with a low intellect (however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed?
t3_2rexe3,cnf8xlt,"I challenge the idea that these are to ""thank them for their service"". In actuality, military discounts serve as an advertisement to draw a certain demographic to your business. They're like coupons in a way, bringing in new customers and making them loyal by giving them 5-10% off, but still making you substantially more profit than if they'd not come in at all. Part of the effect of this advertising is the exclusivity. People wouldn't clip the $1 coupons and come in if just anyone got $1 off. If business owners similarly extended military discounts too far, it could cut into their ability to be effective. On a personal level, though, I agree that ""military discount"" becoming ""public service discount"" wouldn't be a bad idea. It should be noted, however, that this would extend to even people like politicians, teachers, and government administrators"
t3_2rawgb,cneyhn7,"To be fair that's not specific to 4chan and that phenomenon has been around forever(Tumblr's community is heavily guilty of this same thing). It's also a product of individual stupidity, if your believing something random people are telling you without it being backed by proof and your own individual research, well that's your own gullibility. As for 4chan making people into a worse person, I would strong disagree. I'd say more it just lets people be free, free to test the waters and do whatever without your idea's, jokes, concepts tied to any identity. Every thought stands of its own individual merits. I've been around 4chan since 2004 and the only way I would ever describe it would be chaotic neutral . One day groups from or within it might organize some raid for the lolz, URL [finding the girl who threw a puppy in a river,](http://www.techhive.com/article/204615/Video_of_Puppies_Thrown_into_River_Spark_Outcry_and_Sleuthing.html) [saving a girl from bullying and suicide,](http://www.dailydot.com/news/anonymous-kylie-suicide-trolls-bully/) [paying some poor dudes rent,](http://i.imgur.com/kdYBh.jpg) [organizing against the harmful practices of a cult,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Chanology) [bringing more exposure to a rape victim,](http://www.dailydot.com/news/steubenville-rape-confession-video-anonymous/) [give some random vet the best birthday ever,](https://gigaom.com/2010/09/02/4chan-decides-to-do-something-nice-for-a-change/) [helping some guy buy food for his dogs,](http://i.imgur.com/tKwU3.jpg) [raising 5grand for a womens charity,](http://i.imgur.com/yGwmwN4.png) [raising 5grand for suicide prevention](https://www.crowdrise.com/nshgamers/fundraiser/loping) I've honestly seen more positive activism stem from the anonymity culture than I have from any other site. The problem is a lot of people only understand the surface of chan boards like 4chan and equate the anonymity as some cheap way for them to be hateful under the guise of free speech, but that couldn't really be further from the truth. To understand why the board encourages to hate is to understand who goes there and it's obviously the social outcasts. So why would a bunch of social outcasts who get made fun of encourage hate and let such raw emotion reign supreme? Quite honestly it dilutes it. Getting called a faggot on 4chan constantly helps you to brush it off when you hear it on the street, and the nice thing about the anonymity of the 4chan board is essentially you have a new identity with each post letting you brush it off even more. That last post you made someone made fun of you, well cool no one knows that the person who just made the post people are laughing at was the same post they were making fun of. You're no longer the faggot you're the comedian until you make a new post and you're the troll . 4chan style sites don't create pessimistic, negative, and depressed people it just attracts them and quite honestly it's nice to be able to show raw emotion and not have it permanently tied to your identity. You never have to worry about people being like ""oh that dude, that dude always has problems -ignored-"" I've used 4chan a bunch of times to let out my problems about being depressed, suicidal and raped. It's wonderful because I can let it all out and continue to be a member of that community without the community permanently tying what happened to me to my identity. If I fully discussed my rape irl i was always going to feel broken because everyone I talked to would then associate it with my identity and it would be something I would never escape. Even on reddit i was originally hesitant to be open about it because of the username system would tie it to my reddit identity. But on 4chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief. In real life you don't know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen, you don't know if they're just being kind and don't truly care, but on 4chan style board, if no one cares they're not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and don't force anyone to carry their past with them. It's the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn't drag them around to each new thing we do but instead move on and start over. It's this aspect that attracts the people you describe, the site however doesn't create these people it merely attracts them and for many like myself, helps them get out of that mindset in their real life."
t3_2r07cv,cnb8dy3,"Well, I am E. Orthodox, and to be honest if you just look at what the bible says and does not say, explicitly, there is not much useful information to be garnered. This is the deep and inherent flaw to Sola Scriptura (as well as the fact that everyone just can come up with whatever they want it to say, but thats a whole different can of worms). If you are willing to look past the literal letter of the scripture, its rather clear. Marriage is explicitly enshrined as an institute for reproduction, multiple times. Further more sexual immorality is explicitly condemned, in the context of homosexuality among other things as being part of this. This is the more pressing issue however- the Church likely would never consider a person to ever be any gender than the one God made them."
t3_2pqfx4,cmzmqbt,"You're saying that Hip Hop isn't ""getting credit"", but what does that really mean to you, OP? Because I would argue that Hip Hop has been critically applauded in many, many ways, and, you can't get much more credit than archives being created to keep Hip Hop recordings and article clippings in URL . Cornell University recognizes Hip Hop works as something worth studying, and being available to scholars and the public. Additionally, Harvard University began to take it seriously over 10 years ago, in 2002 when it started its Hip-Hop Archive and Research Institute. Think about that, Harvard, a school synonymous with WASP's and privilege, the first thing you may think of when it comes to an ""Ivy League"" school, values Hip Hop so much they have a Research Institute and archive. A lot of other commenters are talking about the comparison you're making to the the glorification that Rock ""legends"" like Hendrix and The Stones have gotten. However, consider that their heyday was the 60's and 70's, whereas hip hop didn't really hit it's stride until the early 90's. I'd make a side point here that many early 90's genres are only just now getting major criticism recognition, and that's often for artists/styles that are effectively dead and gone (re: nirvana). Hip Hop, however, is still evolving, changing, and being mass produced, by artists both good and bad."
t3_2pmtj8,cmy67dn,"I do believe that the enjoyment of movies is subjective (like all art, really) and that is why your argument can't stand. Everybody likes something different and even the most mediocre piece of art, directed at general audiences, will polarize people's enjoyment. Members of a viewing audience will agree and disagree on their favourite aspects of a film and that debate is what drives movie culture. I would agree that the movie industry is stagnating. It is less about creative ability and much more about making money, however, that is an argument for another post."

t3_2o66aa,cmktxrs,"Your reasoning is valid but I disagree with the response you choose. Let's talk about the Facebook link you showed.

Try to consider, however, that the people commenting on her beauty may be doing so in an effort to be compassionate."

It doesn't have to be unanimous, only a supermajority of 2/3 or 3/4. But it was. That means all 12 people agreed that the immense conflict in testimony, combined with the forensic evidence, meant that it was more likely than not that Wilson did not commit the crime. Furthermore, the perspective of the outcome really does matter. Probable cause really isn't a difficult standard to meet. Beyond reasonable doubt, however, is much more difficult."

t3_2m34jb,cm0licf,"Firstly, when was this mythical time when we were ""cave men and women and men would typically have multiple partners in order to pass their lineage on?"" What ancient world cultures are you referencing, from where, who were they - that entire thing is a variation on a golden age myth. Ancient humans had complex relationships also - so your assumptions here about ancient civilizations are over-simplistic and not really based on historical evidence. Some ancient folks had 2-person relationships; some didn't. Which is to say, no, humans are not meant to be monogamous. Humans are meant to survive, period. That's it. Which means humans are meant to be adaptable. Which means humans are meant to not only be adaptable as individuals, but also as a species/group. Which means some people will fall more on one side of a spectrum, and others will fall more on the other. All of which is to say, the natural state of humans appears to be to have there be a tension between the desire to partner/pair up and reproduce, and the desire to still sex up people who are not your partner. Seems like a lot of what we choose to do with these desires is something that society has provided - similar to how we don't just steal what our neighbor has just because we want it or have less, but instead have learned to work together in ways that at least benefit the majority in certain ways. This is true in many domains with people - our lot is to exist between a multiplicity of tensions of opposites. We want to be present-oriented to enjoy ourselves, but we have to be future-oriented to maintain longevity, and past-orientation can teach us a lot of things. Too much of any one and we'll be employing sub-optimal living strategies. In a society, some people can be too much one way, and others too much the other, and that's how everything gets done, as long as people don't start fighting over it. Which they often do, of course. Loyalty to one person isn't ""wrong,"" just as screwing everyone we could possibly want also isn't ""wrong."" Both benefit us, just in different ways. Humans evolved to employ reason (at least to some extent) and so we can exercise that reason and try to sculpt the life and lifeview that we wish to use during the exceedingly brief time when we're alive. So, no - humans aren't meant to be monogamous. But nor are we meant to be polyamorous, or whatever word you want to use to refer to having a multiplicity of partners. We are, however, able to do all of those things."
t3_2kuu7n,clp4w50,The problem with your plan comes down to the impact it will have on businesses. First profit is a concept that is difficult to nail down. There are a million ways to manipulate a company's profits (look at amazon which chooses to invest in itself instead of booking a profit). If you tried to cap company profits you would only be encouraging companies to play games with their revenues in order to ensure they fell under that cap. You would not cause them to change their fundamental business practices however.

t3_2kfldi,clkuur6,"The point isn't that there are plenty of followers of Islam who don't kill people. That is pretty much a smokescreen argument that people like Rezla Azlan and other PC liberals use to smear and misrepresent the true argument that people like Sam Harris and Bill Maher make. There are good Muslims out there, most of them are, but they are good because they are moderates who don't take their religion literally. The ones who do take their religion literally have much more direct verses of violence, hatred and oppression they can look to to justify their hate. The Quran has URL of verses that can turn one to violence. The Bible by comparison only has URL , and it is in a section of the bible that Christians don't strictly follow. I don't think pointing this out, and pointing out that places that operate under the laws of this book are more oppressive, violent, and sexist is bigoted at all. It's actually fair criticism. What is dangerous however is what people who cry ""islamophobe"" are doing because by saying that fair criticism is bigotry, they are censoring it, and letting these disgusting human rights violations continue."
t3_2kacra,cljftmb,"I think that you are confusing two separate sets of data. The studies that show that women earn ""77 cents to every man's dollar"" are talking about lifetime gross earnings. Basically, this is saying that a woman will, on average, make about 3/4 of what a man makes over the course of her entire lifetime. It's taking into consideration things like job growth potential, raises, promotions, etc. What these studies don't say is that if a man and a woman are both working next to each other in an office, the man gets a higher paycheck for the same job. That type of blatant micro-level sexism is not what the data shows. I'm sure that there are some employers that would pay a woman less, but there are also legal protections in place to attempt to correct this. This data really points to a larger macro-level, structural imbalance--women being passed up for promotions, executive positions, etc. So, in a way, you are correct. Men and women doing the same job for the same company probably do make very similar wages. The issue, however, becomes apparent over long stretches of time and large sample sizes."

When I was referring to the ""data"" I was not simply referring to the 2011 study on the 2010 Census--the source of the ""77 cents"" statistic. What I meant to do was identify a trend in the past 50+ years of academic theory and research. Basically, according to the US Department of Labor: For further sources, please see: http://www.ijull.co.uk/vol7/2/thomson.pdf http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/31/cmi-equal-pay-report http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf http://social.dol.gov/blog/myth-busting-the-pay-gap/ I very much understand that there are flaws with the ""77 cents"" figure (as with any point of data). I still firmly hold, however, that whether we want to say that the wage gap is 77%, 90% or even 99.9%, that is an issue that needs to be systemically corrected."

Golf and archery are quite similar, in that they're primarily sports where making perfect, accurate movements with high levels of coordination are most important. Golf drive distance, which can make a pretty huge difference, is also highly influenced by your core strength, height, and general physique.

t3_2k1utj,clh4t7a,"There's an important feature that you're missing in this equation, and that's that acts can take on different values depending on context. For example, forget sex for a second: have you ever made out with someone casually? Or danced with them? Or gone to dinner? What all of these things have in common is that if you do them with someone you're in love with and care deeply about, the act takes on a greater meaning and value, because you're doing it with that person, and that means something to you. The fact that you can have those events be an intimate experience does not mean, however, that that's all they can be."
t3_2jp9x4,clekeze,"There is no reason to think different partners contribute equal value to the relationship. They both contribute something - which is why they want to be together, but that doesn't mean they both work as hard as each other or that their labors are worth the same. If a wife was a lawyer and the husband stayed at home and raised the kids you could easily imagine the wife saying ""I could simply hire a nanny for $X a month to do what you do - that is the free market value of your work and I bring 10 times as much value to our family through my work."" One of the interesting things though is that, generally, lawyers do not marry fork lift operators. Doctors do not marry call center reps, etc. People tend to pare up with partners of equal intelligence, skill, and ambition. In a situation like that, two doctors with a kid, one doctor said ""look we could hire a nanny but that isn't going to create the same kinds of bonds. we have so much money we don't need any more what if i stayed home with the kids and really built a relationship with them?"" the understanding is that the work being done is worth an equivalent amount within that relationship. This isn't necessarily the case however: there are some situations where one partner is rich, the other beautiful, and they most certainly are not contributing equally to the relationship."
t3_2j28la,cl7ri4n,"So, I have nothing to say regarding your opinions - I agree that the U.S. military budget is way too high, and we could do well to implement a better health care system. One thing that's worth noting, though, is that having a military is not just as socialist as universal healthcare. Military necessarily needs to be provided for by the government, since everyone in a society benefits from having national defense yet nobody has an incentive to pay for it, so no private organization would ever be able to fill that niche. In other words, it is a pure public good because it is non-rival and non-excludable (in fact, it is the best, and some would say only good example of a pure public good). The healthcare system, on the other hand, can be provided for by private organizations. There are, of course, reasons that the level of healthcare provided by the private market is too low or the prices are too high, but it can be provided for on some level. Because of the inefficiencies of the market, however, it can be worthwhile for the government to step in, and create a public system on some level."

t3_2izt1m,cl7sekd,"I want to take a crack at this. Before I get into the subject matter, I want to build my ethos a bit (to show I'm not just making all this up). I do a lot of side work for Scott Horton, the host of Antiwar Radio and The Scott Horton Show. He's a longtime editor of Antiwar.com, and most of what I'm about to say, I got directly from him (just now). The first thing that is really important to note is that non-interventionism will not prevent every crisis. Not even Ron Paul would say that. It will however, prevent escalation of various crises."
t3_2iwveo,cl800qa,"The first question is, ""Are there, in fact, people?"". The answer is obviously yes . Therefore person-hood exists. The second question is, ""Have people always existed? If you travel back in time, do certain individuals not exist?"" The obvious answer is that people come into being at some point in time Therefore personhood has a definable point in time. I did not exist before 1988 (my birth year) and my daughters did not exist, or attain personhood, before 2011 and 2013. you cannot argue they have personhood now, did not have it before those years, and at the same time contend that personhood is indefinable . Since we now know that people don't exist before they are born (or conceived for sake of argument), and certainly do exist afterwards, it makes perfect sense that personhood comes from not being....into being . It therefore follows that there must be an objective definition of personhood available to us that would satisfy almost all situations. There are obviously many ideas on this, two of which I find persuasive. 1. The human mind is the most unique characteristic of human beings, the thing that sets us the most apart from everything else. I do not agree with this argument but rather find it among the strongest available. It proposes that there exists a fuzzy line between ""non-human"" bundles of growing cells and ""human cells"" with the bare minimum capacity for thought on human levels. My philosophy buddy argued that in this fuzzy transition line lies the time of personhood attainement. He thought that perhaps the signs of being able to dream, or better yet brain activity in abstract thought processing areas of the fetal brain served as a good guideline. 2. My favored argument, but controversial because of its implications. I argue that as you have said, human life begins at conception. I say this because it satisfies the two conditions in that statement, human and life . We know it is human because the genetic code cannot be argued to be that of any other species, and indeed is an individual of the species own unique genetic code. even identical twins have very very slight differences in their genetic codes, on the order of a few base pairs, but different no less. so that satisfies the human part . What about life ? Interestingly enough some scientists have tried comming up with a definition of life for, of all things, space exploration. Their concepts have application for all biology however."
t3_2isiv7,cl525xl,"In a perfect world there would be no illegal immigration. Everyone in a country would be there on a recognized legal status and be able to participate in the democratic process to various degrees (either getting to vote, or be a candidate in, elections) if they are in the country permanently. However if we do have immigrants who for some reason want to permanently reside in the country but are incapable of passing a test on civics I do not think it is appropriate to give them the vote. This however would be a very rare case as people allowed to immigrate should be more than intelligent enough to pass the citizenship test."
t3_2irrk7,cl4y7m2,"I'm always a bit puzzled by this kind of position. What kind of 'solution' do you propose for this? How is it workable? Perhaps you're just asserting this as your view for part of a moral code - that 'right' action and behavior includes not referring to people as their race, but only their nationality. As with most moral arguments that don't involve a legalistic element, this one seems absurd to me. First of all, you can't ever 'accomplish' this; it's a goal that can't be reached (this isn't damning in and of itself). But, more importantly I don't think we could ever come close and that this is more akin to fantasy than reality.

t3_2iht9m,cl2lqsw,"So I'm gonna dissect your argument a bit, and hopefully change your view. Firstly, you assume that there's a correlation specifically with Gordon Ramsey and the suicides, which is may hold some merit but consider this. Reality TV is about making money off of people's interpersonal drama. To even be considered you really have to be able to demonstrate that you're ""A character with a story."" Any sane entrepreneurial cook could become successful with due diligence and proper know how, so you already have to be mentally offset to get onto reality TV or even WANT to get on Reality TV in the first place. Secondly, you have to consider the profession. Each profession has some nifty suicide statistics attached to it. For the longest time, Dentists were at the top of that list because people rarely have a positive experience at the dentist and so it's good luck to you getting patients and keeping your practice open. Highly stressful, highly depressing situation. Now, I couldn't find any particular statistics on chef based suicides, however a quick google search will yield a higher amount of both drug and alcohol abuse among the cooking profession, which needless to say can lead to depression."
t3_2i4ujn,ckz1of3,"You've way oversimplified. First, you need to define what boundaries you are putting around what counts or doesn't count as being ""Islam"" or ""cause related to Islam"", or a ""problem of Islam"". I think you are equivocating a lot around that concept. For example, do we abstract out levels to generalizations or leave it as specifics. If, for instance, instability and backwardness of the region is largely a result of Islam, particularly the fighting between factions of Islam as well as between Muslims and non-Muslims in the region, does that count as being a ""problem of Islam"", or is that a problem of religion in general, or of innate tribalist (in-group, out-group) tendencies? One might say it is all of these things. Except that not all tribalist tendencies result in this type of situation and not all religious disputes result in it either. But sometimes it does. Does any of that matter here since we are, in fact, talking about Islam only here. Sure, we could argue about some hypothetical other religion in the region causing similar problems, but that hypothetical world is not this world . In this world, it is Islam that is the problem in that region. And indeed it is Islam that led to much of the problems in that region. Much of it used to be far more advanced, with men and women more free before more fundamentalist Muslims collectively gained power. By your reasoning, we can explain away just about everything. There was nothing wrong with Naziism then, because all it did was exploit existing Lutheran antisemitism in the region that led to the Holocaust. Had Naziism not done it, some other belief system would have, so let's stop blaming the Nazis. As you've even stated, ""Political, social, and economic disorder breed radicalism (see: post-WWI Germany)"". Therefore, Naziism isn't a problem either. How is that any different? To be of explanatory value, you need both causal relationship and predictive power of unique features leading to that relationship. For example, Hitler's parents having sex had a causal relationship to the Holocaust but it has no predictive value. We can't know somebody had sex and predict it could lead to a holocaust. We can, however, look at Mein Kampf and predict that this sort of thinking, in power, could be very harmful."

I think your mistake here is that you're defining a rational fear to be something which entails a loss, and then defining loss in a way that makes death not a loss. Definitions are arbitrary, so let's restate the question. Do you think there is something ""wrong"" or not justified about a person saying that they are afraid of death, or taking actions to avoid death (or however fear translates into action)?"
t3_2gi67o,ckkjw7q,"The first place it breaks is here. Criminal law, civil law and private entities are not linked ""in tandem"". They are separate systems which all function differently. Sometimes one action is allowable under one system but prosecutable under another. someone unjustly breaking a contract for example is not an issue in criminal court but grounds for legal action in civil. Other times one action is grounds in two or more systems. For example grievous bodily harm is both criminal (dealing with the injury) and civil (liability for financial harm). However, because they're independent systems acquittal in one doesn't mean acquittal in all of them. This has to do with the standard of proof required for each. OJ for example was acquitted at the criminal trial because there was reasonable doubt. He was however, convicted in civil court because by a balance of probabilities."

We were the first serious relationship for either person. To preface, this post will be anecdotal, but with that said, several points to consider: 1. Everyone is different. There are certainly people that do not belong in relationships in high school. However, positive raindrops early in life teach people, especially men, how to be better mates and parents. http://www.childtrends.org/?indicators=dating As the above study notes, teenagers who don't date are more likely to engage in fwb or ""hookup"" situations, which are worse than serious relationships for a variety of reasons. That said, the literature available acknowledges that teenagers who date seriously are at higher risk for negative relationships and pregnancy, as well as divorce. Three things to address there: 1. Teens are much more impressionable and under more supervision than adults on average. This means there are greater opportunities for correction and education on what a healthy relationship is; 2. adequate sex ed has been proven to lower pregnancy rates. 3. The CMV talks about serious relationships, not marriage. If we talk about marriage in this context, I happen to agree; however, the prompt said relationships."

The ""well regulated militia"" they speak of does not refer to self organized citizens but rather state run armies.

What about that Gazans didn't vote for Hamas or voted for Hamas for the governance promises, not the rhetoric? What if they voted for Hamas because Hamas was the only party that made an attractive argument in providing social services? You can be sure there are some in this category who have died from Israeli actions since 2006. There would also be collateral deaths from Gazans who are politically apathetic, who didn't vote for anyone. Not to mention the innocents, the women and children that have become collateral damage. Even if you accept the idea that those who voted for Hamas deserve it, the ones that didn't support them would not, but are simply unlucky for being born in Gaza. For an US analogy, no-one voted for Bush because they knew the armed forces will end up in Afghanistan and Iraq for a decade, along with the decline of American influence world-wide. Even the ones that voted for Bush may not have supported the resultant Neoconservative foreign policy but for domestic issues. As well, the 9/11 victims may not have supported American actions in the Middle-East that would be one principle cause of the terrorist attack. If you argue however, the Gazans that deserve the Israel attacks are the ones that voted for Hamas specifically for the rhetoric about Israel, your argument may have more merit."

Where I'd argue against you is that the baddies aren't necessarily male humans - I feel just as bad about the stupid Kobolds. :P These masses of baddies as an obstacle to be killed suck whether they're male, female, human, or not (*The Hobbit* had that dreadful scene with the goblins... how many died that day? The thinking behind it is just weird to me). Granted, if you had a game or film full of female human baddies and a thousand of them bit the bullet, there would be something of an outcry, because it would feel exceptional. But it's basically the same idea as Goombahs and Creepers. (I like Creepers.)

t3_2bdmlg,cj4r6pc,"It's strange as an American to wonder why other countries can't do this, but it's relatively simple. America is huge and completely isolated from realistic threats. Let's take the N. Korea situation for example. Are they a threat to us? No, not really. Their lack of long range missile capability more or less eliminates the threat of nuclear destruction. Why is it our concern? Well, because S. Korea is our ally. They provide economic benefit, plus they're a strong(ish) military presence in Asia which allows the US to station their own military presence in the area. This relationship wouldn't work out if S. Korea didn't symbolize US standards for a country. It also wouldn't work out if the US didn't state military support for S. Korea if N. Korea attacked, whether invasion or nuclear attack. This should be more than enough reason as to why we help other countries, but I assume you're thinking more about situations like Crimea and the Malaysian crash, so I'll try to talk about that. Well, technically, it has none immediately. But let's consider how the Ukrainian situation could play out. Let's say Ukraine ended up handling the Crimea invasion differently and fired shots. Well, now Russia feels they have precedent to invade mainland Ukraine. The Ukraine isn't in NATO, so we have no legal reasons to help still. But Poland and Lithuania hold Ukraine as an ally and may defend them. This now gives Russia reason to move into these additional countries. Well these countries happen to be NATO now. As far as I know, we still have no legal reason to help because they're not the defending party. Basically, the point I'm getting at, is when does it become our problem. The situation doesn't feel as pressing in America, but when you're in Europe it feels very different. Other countries that are closer allies to us could get involved until the majority of Europe is involved. Now you've got a WWIII scenario. You might look back at WWII and think well of course we should have joined the war with the Allies and attack the Nazis, but that's because you're looking back on it rather than living it. Hitler was given appeasement just as allowing Russia to have Crimea is a form of appeasement. WWI and II didn't start over nite. They started from many problems that snowballed into larger and larger ones. Now let's say America is the same geopolitical force now, but place them into the 1930's.

t3_2atkq9,ciyvkn0,"Irony generally describes a situation in which a certain action is taken which results in the direct opposite of your expectations occurring. There are quite a few examples in the song which do not seem ironic at all, in my opinion: An old man turned ninety-eight/
He won the lottery and died the next day : Winning the lottery does not carry the expectation of directly increasing your lifespan; the action and result are not related. Moreover the man was quite old already, so it is not an unexpected outcome that he died. It's a black fly in your Chardonnay : This situation might be unexpected, but it is not ironic. There is no direct expectation that there will never be a fly in your drink. The issue of flies in a drink is generally not a conscious concern for people drinking alcohol. It's like rain on your wedding day : Your explanation for this line was that it was an example of situational irony, because women tend to ""plan their weddings meticulously and have an expectation of control."" However, I think you are reading too much into this solitary verse. Morisette does not mention a woman (instead using your ), or that the wedding had been planned explicitly on a day with the intent of avoiding bad weather. The intent of this lyric seems to be of giving an example of an unfortunate event, which is not the definition of irony. It's a free ride when you've already paid : You have conceded that this does not seem ironic, and I agree. It's the good advice that you just didn't take : To quote one of your other posts, ""I agree that this one line is not ironic"". ---------------------------- I also disagree that the plane crash is ironic, since not enough information is given on Mr. Play It Safe's expectations of the flight. After all, you can still do an action while being afraid that something will go horribly wrong. For example, a construction worker may be afraid of falling off a roof, but still proceeds to work in such a situation. Since the man's expectations of boarding the plane are never elaborated on, we are left to speculate whether or not he expected the plane to crash, ergo we cannot conclusively say whether or not it is situational irony. However, judging from your responses, I do not think you will find this line of reasoning convincing. I do agree, however, that the man's quip is a perfect example of verbal irony."

Critics are not always in agreement, the opinion on artwork changes over time: one could certainly find a current critic's darling overrated, and consensus may agree with me them in a decade. For example, John Updike was widely celebrated as great novelist during his lifetime, yet more recent critics have found him to be URL . One reading him during his heyday could have found the same issues as current critics do, and yet they would (according to your metric) be unjustified in their judgement until enough critics shared the same viewpoint. One of the major issues that the modern establishment has with Updike is his narcissistic, misogynist viewpoint and yet you'll note the linked article only quotes male critics from any generation. I don't believe one needs to be a woman to note this issues in his writing, however, it does speak to another point: critics are not a perfect representation of the populous."

People who don't work hard do poorly. In other words, you get what you 'merit' in the system. Quick history lesson: this is the bedrock idea of our country. America, as it was becoming a nation, had a lot of problems. Nations were based on very specific sets of criteria. They shared a religion. They shared a language. They shared a king/queen, an ethnicity, a stable geographical boundary, a history. America had none of that. It was a hodge podge of languages, religions, ethnicity, cultures, and very flexible geographical boundaries. There was no way, really, to call it a nation in the way Europe would conceive of such a thing. Instead, America formed around a national ideology, taken pretty much directly from the Puritans if you strip the 'God' parts out, and recycled into a kind of manifest destiny. The idea was simple: This is the place where you can be anything you want to be. Unlike classiest Europe with a dearth of social mobility, this will be built on the meritocracy of ideas and people.

t3_29oi1n,cimz15m,"You really have to address these separately as they are very different sports. I personally don't care for baseball, but it is fun for people who enjoy statistics. Because of the nature of the game, every player's effectiveness can be broken down into a series of stats (ERA, RBIs, hits, on base percentage, batting average, etc.). This means that anyone who has fun studying or playing around with numbers has a great deal of things they can analyse about baseball. Personally, I find American Football to be the funnest sport in the world to watch. Every millisecond that the ball is in play has something important happening, and could potentially only be a few seconds from either team scoring. Few other sports have the same concentration of excitement. Meanwhile, in between the snaps, there is a great deal of strategy and mind games involved as each team tries to guess what the other is going to do and adjust accordingly. As someone who has played all three, I find this idea laughable. There is very little metagame strategy involved in MMA. It mostly consists of something along the lines of ""He's better standing, and I'm better on the ground. So, I want to get him on the ground."" Soccer has a bit more strategy, but it is still rather simplistic and mostly relies on execution. Meanwhile, a football team will completely change the way they play against different teams. If your opponent has a star wide receiver, then you double cover him. If their quarterback tends to hold the ball, you pass rush. At the same time, if you see double coverage, you run plays that pass to a different guy or run it. If you see a pass rush coming, you use short passes or draw plays. The strategy is different after every play and needs to be constantly adjusted, rather than being mostly or completely decided before you ever set foot on the field. What I find most enjoyable about the NFL, however, is the sheer athletic prowess demonstrated."

t3_29n4wo,cio9nnh,"The interesting thing for me is that I think I agree with all of your points and can't find a massively great specific rebuttal to almost any of them, however I have a general rebuttal. One thing I'd like to point out is that many if not most of the points you present seem to possibly imply that all relationships are or must be, by definition, monogamous. I think most of the points you gave are actually excellent general reasons for a given person to perhaps consider polyamory instead. It's still quite socially taboo, and though I'll probably take heat for this, I tend to notice most people are far more accepting of gays/lesbians/whatever than they are of polyamorous people. I don't know if any of the following directly addresses explicitly any of your numbered points but I think it at least implicitly addresses some of them. 1. Level of desire/level of willingness to change/no one owes anyone anything. Yeah I pretty much agree on this aspect, and I think it's kind of a perfect rationale for polyamory. Before I go further I'd like to clarify that while very obvious in its slant, this post is in no way trying to say that polyamory is the only or the best arrangement for humans and that much of the stuff I point out is the general state of the emotional psychology of the human species. I myself tend towards a desire for monogamy, but I think there is ample rationality to support the idea that polyamory may be a better overall social construct by which to conduct our lives. Friendships are relationships too, and I think far too many people make the mistake of both ignoring friends as potential sexual partners, and also the converse mistake of assuming their sexual partners are automatic loyal friends. I think there's a certain level of deep satisfaction that is achieved in friendship and I constantly hear people talk about a break up as having lost ""a best friend"". Consider maybe humans would be better off if we completely removed the social stigma of who people have sex with when and why and the limitations and restrictions of only being able to have sex with a single person at a time. There would probably be far more opportunities for all humans to find not only friends but sex partners as well. There would probably be far more opportunities for you to have sex with one of the select few highly attractive people that you say are the only ones you're attracted to enough to consider having sex with. I think a vast majority of potential sexual relationships don't occur simply out of social stigma for not wanting to be seen or known to be having sex with another person for various social stigma reasons - that person is a geek, or fat, or otherwise socially unattractive, yet in my experience, often times the growth of genuine close intimate friendship starts to trump those originally perceived problems. I think shallow is a term leveled by people who are probably shallow themselves because of exactly this reason - that they know there are many people with whom they'd gladly and willingly have casual (but really nothing is ever casual) sexual relations and with whom they'd like to develop a deeper/further/lasting/intimate friendship/bond but they avoid doing so because of perceived social stigma and not because of their actual internal desires and also because doing so would likely preclude the possibility of being able to ""do it"" with someone better if someone better came along. As the saying goes, the grass is always greener. Also given that we have placed this social emphasis on being exclusive to a single person at a time, that leaves very little room for leeway in bad behavior and it brings about conversations and discussions on an order of magnitude that is blown far out of proportion to what normal people engage in in their normal every day friendships. While it sometimes happens, friends far less often badger their friends to stop drinking than do monogamously romantic partners. The simple reason for this is that friends usually have other friends they can go hang out with and don't have to put up with Bob's drinking but Bob is still fundamentally fun to hang out with and drink with from time to time. When a person is stuck with a sexual partner, there tends to develop a pretty intense desire for that sexual partner to be adequately fulfilling, and the ways in which that partner is not adequately fulfilling are magnified far more times over than would normally be the case if that relationship were more like a good/intimate/deep regular friendship. So people try to change each other. Secondly, lets consider the situation of human happiness/satisfaction/fulfillment in the context of statistical analysis. I feel there is an artificial emphasis on romantic relationships presented to society by the media, however caveats come to mind."

Can't people advocate for development of a women-based game development market and call out people for, frankly, dubious claims about present development? I'm pretty sure that there are women developers out there trying to get their projects off the ground, but they're hardly as salient as the editorials etc. published about present development. It's a frequent topic of discussion at /r/girlgamers. It seems, to me, that you're in something of a feedback loop because, however low the barriers to entry are for making games, the barriers are even lower to write about current games, and thus you're going to see more 'complaining' (a term seemingly reserved for women's grievances, rather than 'critique' or 'criticism' or 'review') than development."
t3_27dypa,ci0bdgm,"I'm going to address your personal account first. Let's lay out the facts: you had told her ""no"" several times in the past, she was aware that you did not want to have sex with her, she waited until the power dynamics between the two of you were in her favor (she had full control over her mental and physical faculties, while you did not), and she took advantage of that power dynamic. There was no consent until you were at a disadvantage (if there was consent at all - if you don't remember what happened, you may never have given her the go ahead). This is pretty clearly rape, to me. Whether or not you put yourself at a disadvantage is completely irrelevant. If Jessie sees Jamie fall and hit their head on a rock - let's say for the sake of argument that Jessie knows Jamie has a concussion - then proceeds to have sex with Jamie even though they know Jamie would never consent to it otherwise, that's rape. It doesn't matter that Jessie did not personally hit Jamie with the rock, what does matter is that Jessie took advantage of Jamie when Jessie knew they were in a more coherent state of mind than Jamie was. Yes, you are always accountable for YOUR actions. What you are not accountable for is the actions of others. When you make the decision to get in your car and drive when drunk, these are your actions alone. When you make the decision to stab someone or shoot someone while drunk, these are your actions alone. When you make the decision to ignore another person's lack of consent prior to sex while drunk, these are your actions alone. [Aside: for the second example (murder) it is possible that your state of drunkenness may change what degree of murder or manslaughter is argued.] However, when sex occurs between two people when one person is drunk, there are two people's actions that need to be taken into consideration. Again, a dichotomy of power exists between a clearly inebriated person and a completely sober (or even tipsy) person, with the power being in the sober person's favor. When a sober person makes the decision to initiate sex with a clearly inebriated person, they are taking advantage of the amount of power they have over the other person (especially if they knew that the person would not consent if they weren't drunk). The drunk person cannot be held responsible for their actions (or in this case, their reaction) when a clear-minded person is essentially coercing them. Now, if a clearly inebriated person initiates sex with a sober person then they are responsible for this action. However, the sober individual still has more power in the situation than the drunk individual. If the sober person consents when they know the other person is not in their right state of mind, they are still taking advantage of that power. In either of these cases, the sober person has, in essence, raped the the drunk person. Where it becomes unclear is when two people are equally drunk. This brings the situation back down to equal footing - no one can claim to be at a disadvantage since both are of an equally unclear state of mind. You are responsible for initiating sex with the other person, and the other person is equally responsible for reciprocating. This does not mean, however, that rape cannot happen when two people are drunk."
t3_2766rt,chxsyh1,"Philosophers refer to this as the ""Problem of Evil."" The classic restatement is that God cannot be Omnipotent, Omnibenevolent, and Omniscient because a God having all three of these qualities would not allow so much evil to exist in the world. Unfortunately there has never been a perfectly satisfactory answer to this problem. One classic answer is that we have no context by which to judge God or the relative ""goodness"" of the world. God is the only one with a universal perspective, so he may have an excellent reason for all of this that we just don't comprehend. We can't judge god's actions or reasoning because we lack infinite perspective. This is probably the most solid answer that I am aware of; however, it kind of hoses the idea of God's Omnibenevolence in the first place... if he is ""Good"" but it is not a good that we can understand, why would we call him good at all?"

t3_26z994,ci473oh,"So, I don't exactly agree with everything the blogger you linked to said. Specifically, I think she puts way too much focus on strangers. Not that anyone, (women or men), should just go around handing out trust to strangers. Hell no. But I think such a focus obscures what I consider to be a much bigger threat, (with rape anyway): people you know. Or sort of know. Family, 'friends,' acquaintances, family/friends of your friends. People you are likely to be alone with at some point in time, or people who can 'get you alone.' BUT I do agree with what she says about ignoring communications of 'No' being a GIANT FUCKING RED FLAG. There is something to be said for persistence and perseverance, in general. But if a man is pursuing me, and I tell him I am not interested in any contact with him, and he continues to pursue me, he ABSOLUTELY gets put into the category of ""Doesn't listen to me when I say no."" And that bumps him way up my predator radar. The other thing that occurs to me now is that, I too, have advised women to just NOT be alone with men that haven't earned their trust. And that does sound a bit alarmist, but I'm afraid I have to stand by it. Certainly there are situations that this doesn't apply to: many work environments, delivery people, home contractors, etc. I say it doesn't apply, because (1) It's just too impractical. These things are going to be impossible to avoid. (2) These situations are a bit harder for the rapist to 'get away with it.' IMO Situations I do mean: Going to a private residence with someone that has not yet earned your trust (unless you have fantastic people instinct), taking them back to your home, in a house party setting going to a secluded area where people can't really see you, etc. The reason I 'encourage this fear' is that, although the sense that I was/am small 'prey' starting developing in my late teens, it didn't actually hit home until after I was sexually assaulted. And that's true for other women that I know as well. I think that this is something that is more important to talk to young people about, not for 'early education' but because they haven't had as long to develop communication skills. Boys (who are still growing) are not yet fully aware of their size, strength, especially compared to most girls. Girls learn (IMO) to communicate in subtle ways growing up, and haven't yet learned that being completely forthright and blunt is the best way to communicate when you need someone to listen to you. As an adult, were I placed in that same situation, I can now communicate well enough that I'm pretty confident I could express to the boys who assaulted me I wasn't actually just playing hard to get. I genuinely believe they thought I was, they actually didn't realize my 'no' meant: 'I don't want you take my clothes off. I don't want to have sex with you. I really don't. I'm not attracted to you. And even if I was, I really, really, don't want to have sex on this dirty floor. And even if I wanted to have sex on this floor, I don't want you to eat me out, because you've been drinking beer and it will given me a yeast infection and a UTI.' Now I wouldn't just say 'No."" I would not put my faith in their ability to understand what that one word meant to me. I would say exactly what I said here. Which is much more clear. Now, though, I can keep a cool head when I'm terrified. I have practiced and learned that skill. Then, I was so scared, it was all I could do to say 'No.' That was all I was capable of. Learning to communicate like this, and learning to keep a cool head when you're scared, takes time and practice. It doesn't just happen. It's not something I can teach to another woman or girl quickly. I can, however, simply tell her, ""Do not be alone with a man that has not earned your trust."""

I do present this style of argument any time I am asked, either online or offline, and yeah I do feel like I am definitely in the majority in terms of desires within feminism - however, the screaming crazy minority can unfortunately be louder than than majority sometimes and this makes things difficult for the more calm among us."
t3_25gqr3,chh8rrt,"As with all logic, the existence or non-existence of God hangs on some assumptions. Here are mine: 1. The universe exists. 2. The universe has physical limits. 3. The second Law of Thermodynamics (2nd Law) can be taken as true until a single counterexample can be found. 4. The rule of cause-and-effect applies outside the Universe as well as in. That is to say, effects still require cause, even if the 2nd Law doesn't apply somewhere outside the universe. Assuming the universe exists, it must have either (1) existed forever, (2) had a beginning. If the universe has existed forever, it is infinitely old, but is not infinite in its material content, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics implies that the universe would have achieved a perfectly stable maximum state of entropy (in other words, has all worn down to complete homogeneity). As an aside, some consider the possibility of a cyclical universe that has periodic big bangs, then collapses in on itself and repeats. This would necessarily require a violation of the 2nd law of Thermodynamics (though admittedly the conditions of pre-big-bang universe have not been replicated in the lab). Furthermore, they don't line up with a universe that is accelerating outward. So that theory contradicts observable scientific evidence. I can observe that the universe has not achieved maximum entropy, and conclude that it must have a beginning. This ""beginning"" is an effect that logically requires a Cause. I'm going to define that Cause as God for the sake of this argument. The inevitable follow-up question here asks, ""then what made God?"" If the cause is not eternal, and itself had a cause, then one must trace that back to whatever the prime cause was. Or some infinite cycle of causes, or some other weirdness. Anyway, I'm defining God as either the prime, eternal cause or the latest in the infinite series of causes. In either case, God the Cause necessarily violates some rules (2nd law, etc) of our universe and is not bound by them. God is necessarily outside the universe. My 4th assumption is that cause-and-effect must still apply outside the universe, as we are discussing the logic-worthiness of God's existence, and to throw it out at this point would be self-defeating. So God is directly or indirectly eternal, and created/caused the Universe. The God of the Universe is either personal or impersonal. An example of an impersonal God is the idea that the big bang was caused by the collision of multiple universes. As stated before, at least some of those other universes must not be bound by our universe's rules. Yet if such a universe caused ours, why then does our 2nd law have no exception? Until the counterexample is found, I consider it reasonable to conclude that such an impersonal cause is an unlikely scenario. And any competing theory involving an impersonal God must likewise address this criticism. It is most likely, then, that the God is personal, to be able to create a universe with a substance different than Himself. To apply creativity and distinctiveness to a universe containing, as it does, the 2nd law, without Himself being bound by it. If God is personal, then He either has a plan for humanity or does not. If he has no plan, then any action we take concerning religion or the afterlife is moot. That's an intellectual possibility, but since neither science nor religion has anything to say about such a god, it warrants no further discussion. If however God has a plan for humanity, then He has either revealed it, or has not."

t3_2360o1,cgtz3wv,"I do not think you lack empathy. I think you have conflated individual factors and systemic factors. Individual ""ingredients"" of success include things like talent, hard work, and good decision making. Systemic factors include things like sufficient resources, the performance of the overall economy, etc. Think about it like a race with 10 runners. You are born with (or without) natural talent. You can increase your odds of winning by training hard, eating well, and learning good form. You can increase them more with a personal coach and good equipment. You can increase them even more with blood doping and steroids, though this also increases the risk of DQ. No matter what you do or don't do, though, 9 people are going to lose that race. It's just the nature of the system. You can increase your odds of winning, but you can't decrease the number of people who are going to lose. If you want more people to win, you have to change the rules. There was a black, female, self-made millionaire in America who died in 1919 (Madame CJ Walker). That she was able to succeed does not in any way imply that the system she was operating under supported minorities. Success is more generally possible for minorities than ever before. That does not, however, mean that the system supports minority success to an equal standard."

t3_231sd9,cgtpoek,"I agree with your questioning of moral relativism - it is wrong for us to impose Western morals blindly upon other cultures, but there are clearly also moral absolutes. For instance, genocide is clearly morally reprehensible on a universal scale. And then issues can be slightly grayer, depending on your opinion or religion - female circumcision, for example. Animal rights is clearly one of those issues that is difficult to decide when moral relativism should be applied. Nonetheless, hopefully you can agree with me on two premises, should we choose to evaluate animal rights: 1) The degree of what we consider ethical is inversely proportional to the degree of suffering; the greater the suffering, the less ethical. 2) The degree of what we consider ethical animal treatment is directly proportional to the degree of sentience and emotional capacity. One is less concerned about humane treatment of protozoa and flatworms, for instance, and more concerned with humane treatment of chimpanzees. 3) The degree of what we consider ethical is related to how directly responsible humans are for the situation. For instance, rainforest deforestation, manmade climate change, or DDT poisoning are unethical because the damage caused to the animals in the ecosystem are a direct result of human action. If you can at least agree with me on those premises, then hopefully my argument makes more sense. You're right in that dogs have always been considered a backup food source throughout human history...however that isn't the primary purpose they were bred for, and the selection for intelligence and empathy reflect that."

Theft generally occurs because resources are not widely available. Assuming the best possible outcome for anarchism, and communal warehouses and workshops exist which produce ""luxury"" items, why risk getting hurt (a very real likelihood in a society where your victims could very well be armed) when you could simply get what you wanted without the violence.

t3_21hpd2,cgd84zz,"Furthermore (and this leads into the issue of consciousness), the dog will eventually resign itself to its situation. In the experiments I mentioned, the dogs eventually resigned themselves to the situation; even though they still had energy they stopped trying to escape. That is to say, the dog learned . Learning is not that common a trait. The vast majority of organisms on Earth do not learn behaviours; they follow a set of predetermined instructions until they die. Learning requires consciousness, it requires that an organism recognise the effects of the environment on its self , and then adjust its behaviour to reflect that. This goes well beyond simple instincts in all mammals, as well as a wide swathe of the animal kingdom generally. If that does not meet your definition of consciousness, then I think you are really referring to self-consciousness. In which case, I challenge you to provide an argument as to why organisms with awareness of self should not be exposed to pain, but others can. We know other animals feel pain, how does not having self-awareness lessen that pain? Self-awareness is probably an argument against granting unconditional right to life to these animals; they probably don't know what they're missing, but they can most definitely feel and understand pain. My point on abortion/infanticide wasn't particularly well explained, and it is ultimately an issue you will have to find your own view on. Personally, I would draw the line at the point where the foetus can survive outside the mother. I can see no reason why at this point there is any reason in a developed society to not keep the child alive. There are options such as adoption which will allow the development of self-consciousness in due time. To demand an abortion at 34 weeks is to say that ""the thought of having a biological child, to which I owe no obligation, is so repulsive to me that I consider it better if that entire life never occurs."" This is selfish-ness of the highest order. I would however say that the value of that life is less than that of other contemporary lives."

If you were the CEO of something you started with a great idea that tons of people want, would it be right for the government to step in and say ""no, you make too much, sorry?"" I'd argue no. As for making such a large overhaul, as you suggest, I'd argue that your idea wouldn't work.

t3_2055ga,cg00g0w,"First, it's important to say that your argument is that ""in general, Republicans are hypocrites"", which implies to me that a majority of Republicans are hypocrites. So that's about half of the URL . That's probably at least 40,000,000 people. That's a weighty accusation, and you'd probably have had a more defensible position if you argued that some Republican views were hypocritical, because then you might actually have a bunch of Republicans agreeing. Second, Republicans are a party. Since we have two parties that capture the majority of votes in the country, their platforms will, by necessity, be structured in such a way as to try to rope in a lot of people. Republicans now have at least three clear ideological factions to my eye, those being traditional Goldwater conservatives, tea-party conservatives, and socially conservative religious voters. Those factions don't even necessarily agree on everything (or anything). So, knowing that many Republicans don't even agree with their party's views -- they simply prefer it to the alternative because they highly value some small subset -- are you still comfortable asserting that so many people are, individually, hypocrites? That said, to address the actual points: Point #1: Republicans do lay a clam to being a party of small government. However, everything you've cited as examples of government intervention are questions for which Republicans are morally motivated. Let's imagine someone who believes that law and order and protecting the innocent are proper functions of the government; and that intervening economically to help people who can't help themselves is a function better left to charity. This mindset can easily result in a consistent philosophy that wants the government to intervene when there are victims - whether that is the people who suffer from drug trade, the unborn child/fetus of the woman who wants an abortion, or the invalid who has a right to life even if his spouse wants to end life support. I'm not making an argument that any of these things are immoral. (I even used two terms in the abortion because even the terminology of abortion is completely loaded.) The reality is, we all have a set of moral beliefs, and we all, in general, believe that the government should legislate morality. Sometimes these beliefs are extremely contentious - such as abortion. Other times, there are times when society as a whole has no problem overriding someone's individual choices (for example, we'd generally not be shy about overriding a parent's choice to withhold antibiotics from a sick child, because they believed healing not based on faith was an affront to God). Keeping in mind that many Republicans in the faction of the religiously motivated voters don't even particularly care about economic policy, realize that when they push for candidates to oppose gay marriage, they are doing it strictly out of a sense that it is a sinful act and inherently immoral, and on that grounds, they feel it is not only acceptable but necessary for the government to protect society. I don't at all agree, but it doesn't make them hypocrites. Meanwhile, they quite likely care very little for economic policy - or, at most, they have a vague feeling that the government is large and wasteful, but don't particularly care about the details because they're voting their morality on social issues regardless. What I'd say is that you are seeing their platform views through your own lens. Truth be told, I've used that exact same argument before, because I think it is persuasive to the non-religious Republican. (I also think the fractured factions of the Republicans are responsible for their being unable to play their role in government effectively, and will ultimately lead to a decline in the party or some sort of platform ""purge"" that will marginalize at least one of the competing factions.) Point #2: (Some) Republicans believe that higher taxes stifle growth, especially on people who have money to invest. This is URL 101. Almost everyone on both sides of the aisle believes in the reality of the URL , which posits that there is an optimal tax rate for revenue generation: you can raise taxes up to an optimal point, at which point the taxation becomes too much friction for economic growth and personal motivation, and additional taxes lead to reduced revenues. There's a URL on tax rates on capital gains. I don't actually interpret the results the way that they do, because you'll see that after spikes in revenue, capital gains revenue returns to normal. What basically every economist agrees on is that people respond to incentives. As you can see from the chart, capital gains going up produced a huge spike in revenue also, because people re-allocated capital while they could at a lower rate. Lowering it also raised revenue because people re-allocated it after it was freed up. I think many economists would like some sort of middle ground where capital that was re-allocated from investment to investment was tax free, and capital gains liquidated and spent on consumption were taxed as ordinary income. That said, this explains why they believe that sometimes, cutting taxes can raise revenue. They believe this is stronger on the richer folks, because they invest and investment creates economic growth. The people on the left tend to believe more in demand-side economics; effectively that when people have money to spend, they spend it, and businesses will respond to that opportunity and invest. This is actually very muddy water. For example, URL a very prominent economist and former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors under Bush, is a prominent Keynesian, and wrote: And yet, Mankiw was not convinced that the 2008-2009 stimulus was a good idea, whereas other prominent Keynesians like Paul Krugman actually warned that it was the right idea but smaller than it should have been. And Richard Posner, who is a famous jurist and also a prominent academic economist, URL in his book ""A Failure of Capitalism"". Both sides have a moral component to their view, as well. The leftist view often draws upon the idea of the URL and suggests that the rich earn their fortunes through a mix of luck, circumstances, and genetics. The right would suggest that economic freedom is critical and that man has a right to the fruits of his own labor, and anything less is tantamount to ""slavery"". (I'm quoting that word because I've read it used in that context many times but can't say it with a straight face without the quotes.) The right often borrows from the Ayn Rand viewpoint: They might argue that the most poor, destitute souls of our society have a lot that is far better than they did a hundred or two hundred years ago, and it is the achievements of great people who have led to that. This might manifest in a desire for policy as close to a flat tax as possible, for example, believing that while we must fund things, we should all contribute equal to our production. As far as military spending goes, it is sometimes a tenet on the right that civil and national defense is the primary purpose of government: police and the military effectively being the tool of the government to maintain law and order, and the rest should be left in private hands. So their refusal to cut military spending is consistent with that. There's an obvious counterargument that we spend primarily on proactive ""offense"" than on defense, since we have no real threats directly to our national interests. We do, however, often work to counter threats to our allies around the world, and so there is a counter-counter argument that such spending makes a better world."

t3_2055ga,cg00gpy,"[ ... part two] Point #3: I'll preface this by saying that I think this is easily your best point, I think. That said, there is a possibility here that avoids hypocrisy altogether: you can only fight so many battles. The moralists are pouring their time, energy, and money into fighting against abortion and gay marriage. If they can win those fights, they might pursue other policies that align the government closer to a judeo-christian theocracy, but in the team time, they have their hands full. It's easy to find actual individual hypocrites, of course: preachers and conservative politicians caught in scandals involving prostitutes and bathroom stalls are almost laughably common. The rank and file, however, would likely argue that they're not discriminating at all: they just want to uphold moral behavior in society."
t3_1zyxf5,cfykpyh,"It's hard to change your view, OP, because it has more or less been validated by empirical data.. thus far. To cite one example, since acquiring nuclear weapons, the 'hot' relationship between India and Pakistan has cooled considerably (they even signed an agreement in 1991 not to target each other's nuclear facilities). You are even in good company (not that an appeal to authority is needed). No less than Kenneth Waltz himself has repeatedly argued that what the world needs for stability is more, rather than fewer, nuclear powers. However, there is another perspective you might want to consider. Thus far, you have focused only on the material reality of nuclear weapons. But having nuclear weapons is not the same as being willing to use them, and not all nuclear weapons are equally threatening. That's because our understanding of nuclear weapons are shaped by shared understandings about who has them. British nuclear weapons look different to Americans than do Russian nuclear weapons, despite the fact that British weapons could just as easily kill Americans. It is thus entirely conceivable that a war could be fought because one side believes that enemy leadership (however defined) would never use them -- due to a pre-existing characterization of enemy leadership or perhaps a miscalculation."
t3_1zradb,cfwcpec,"Buckle up, this will be a bit long! So I'm not sure exactly what classes you're taking and what exactly their analysis of it is, but it seems to be a little off. In essence, the public health and medical fields have obtained research results which are causing them to start thinking about SOME (not all!) of the epidemiological basis for obesity in the context of an infectious disease. Like you said, not an infectious disease in the traditional sense (i.e. malaria, HIV), but not fully a chronic disease based solely on behavior and genetics. Generally, infectious diseases have two main characteristics - 1. an infectious agent (virus, bacteria, etc. ); and 2. a method of transmission from vector to host (person-person, animal, water, etc.). In the context of obesity, a lot of work has uncovered similarities to these properties, causing the community to reevaluate the way in which we approach obesity management and therapy. Specifically, URL (published in Nature , 2012) was a major push in that direction - I'll summarize here. Infectious agent - from some previous work expanded on in these experiments, they found that changes in the numbers and diversity of specific strains of gut microbiota (i.e. Enterobacter ) are associated with the onset of both obesity and fatty liver disease. Essentially, a particular group of proteins is changing the way your stomach bacteria function, contributing to risk of affecting metabolic functions. Although in no way is it saying that these bacteria are the sole cause , it was revelatory to realize that infectious particles DO play some sort of role . Additionally, when given antibiotics to reverse the effects back to the normal microbiota environment, disease was slowed. This is similar to when the bacteria H. pylori was implicated in ulcer formation, rather than it being just a combination of environmental (stress) and behavioral (diet), which seemed just absolutely bananas at the time. Transmission - this is the other crazy part. When the scientists put normal mice in the same cages as mice with the different gut microbiomes, the normal mice gained a higher risk of developing obesity/liver disease . This is just fucking nuts! These new mice were getting the contents of their stomach bacteria changed just by being in the same cage, which ultimately increased their own incidence of disease. It's not just some coincidence - the numbers and types of bacteria running around in your tummy are off the charts, and very unique to you. We're really only now getting deeper into parsing out what each one does on its own and how it all functions as a system, but it shows huge potential (heard of URL ?). Another cool thing - with infectious diseases, we generally use transmission modeling to help determine how an infectious agent epidemic will progress in a population based on certain characteristics (how it's spread, transmission factors, lethality, etc.). Social epidemiologists have adapted this method to use for behavioral traits, using social networks (friends, family) rather than purely geographic/contact-based. Turns out that obesity can also be modeled with an [infectious disease model](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000968) , and numerous studies have highlighted the EXTREME ""contagiousness"" of behavior, dietary trends, and health beliefs - essentially, high correlations within social networks trending towards high/low risks of obesity. Depending on applicability in humans, these patterns may also reflect the gut bacteria. So, to sum up: 1. obesity is NOT a traditional ""infectious disease,"" and is absolutely still affected by environment and behavior; 2. however, we've discovered specific gut bacteria which increase risk of obesity AND that they are ""transmissible"" 3. understanding the contagion of obesity like an infectious disease while still incorporating behavioral interventions can help us get a fuller perspective Instead of treating it as a solely INDIVIDUAL-level chronic disease, we can treat it comprehensively and more effectively."

t3_1y3vw7,cfh6xl3,"Everyone here will obviously tell you that the statistics support staying in college and it's true, but there's more to it. You have to put a monetary value on the opportunity cost of dropping out versus getting a degree. Let's take the financial cost. Usually for people college is an investment. As you know they invest money now as they see that the return will be higher in the future. This is unquestionably true in general. You will most likely earn signifcantly more if you remain in college. Further, you have a grant. The only cost for you therefore is the money you're giving up that you would have earned during your time at college. This is a tremendous advantage as people who have to pay their own way are using up their own time working which could be used for studying. You, therefore, have an advantage over them it'd be irrational for you to waste it. Secondly, let's take other costs such as living far away from home or disappointing your parents. This shouldn't factor into your decision as they're only temporary costs. Thirdly - the monetary value of work. Unless you are fairly certain that dropping out to get a job now is going to more financially rewarding than staying in then you shouldn't do it. I'm talking about having a full career lined up where people who have degrees will have no advantages when it comes to the competition for promotion. What is the only industry that fits that description? Entrepreneurship, which is financially costly and has high risks. Finally, you mention you don't think you're learning anything. This may not be satisfying at first but you have to look at the bigger picture. Just having a degree is an advantage regardless of the discipline. Most diplomats don't have International Relations degrees for instance. Most stock brokers don't have Economics degrees or whathaveyou (what I'm studying incidentally). As long as you have a degree you're at an advantage. Ultimately however, there's no monetary value on suppressed ambition so it's up to you."
t3_1xhrpt,cfbkr47,"This is going to be a long post, so if you're not really looking to get your mind changed, move right along. I am going to write up a shorter TL;DR first, and then an in-depth after. I study world religions. It started as a hobby, then it became a habit, and I just haven't stopped. If you have any questions or are unclear on something, just ask. Most people that you meet, and from reading your post I am guessing this includes you, are woefully under-educated about the actual tenets of other belief systems. The top two that this happens with in my experience are #2) Buddhism and #1) Islam, by a mile. It's actually a little horrifying how far construed this is from reality. Islam gets a seriously bad rep, primarily from Western Christian cultures, that is not entirely undeserved, and it originates from the beginnings of the religion. Whereas Christianity's real story begins with a savior who was everything the people of the Middle East did not expect: kind, loving, forgiving, and nonviolent, the story of Islam starts with a brilliant young man who would become a soldier. But more on that later, first: TL;DR: The horrific things you see today are not actually the ""teachings of Islam"", but are a political tool that has been used on and off for centuries to attempt to gain control of people and gain political/societal dominance and fit it into a religious context for the sake of gaining a following. These people are put into the forefront of Western media for the sake of building a demonized image of the people that the Western world is currently having political tensions and/or war with. It's got a lot to do with old grudges, past wars, and Israel, but I am not getting into that political minefield even later on in the post, for the sake of my own sanity. The idea of Islam being a violent culture originates from this media representation as well as a couple other key factors such as: The Qur'an: Have you seen the Muslim population's reaction to the US burnings of the Qur'an? You think to yourself, ""people don't flip shit like that over the Bible being burned!"". But the Qur'an is not the Bible. If you want to draw a corollary between something in Christianity to the Qur'an, the most accurate analogy you could make is that the Qur'an is Jesus. It is the infinite, untainted and most holy work of God. It was not made by the hands of man but instead those hands were merely used to make it visible to us. The Qur'an is far holier than the Bible ever has been, and the reaction it produces it proportional to its importance. Jihad: Yeah, yeah, Jihad doesn't mean what Westerners think it means, blah blah, we've heard that before, but in the context of actually going to war over your beliefs, this is real. The issue here is that these young men are portrayed as Muslims . That's only as accurate as it is to say URL was a Christian. The reason there are more of them than there are mass murderers of other religions is that they are in an ideal environment for cultivating new ones. An oppressed, poor population, repeatedly invaded, with lots of angry stupid young men looking for someone to blame, and there just so happen to be a few evil people who have some answers for them. You'd be horrified if you heard the stories these men are told. There are radio stations that do nothing but report the horrific actions (real or false, doesn't matter) of American soldiers raping and shooting young women, burning homes to the ground, and basically doing everything an evil invader would do. Wouldn't you fight back for the sake of your homeland and people if someone was doing that to your land? End TL;DR #Somewhat Rambling Explanation of Past Trends in Islam Leading to Current Image Jesus lived in an area that was kept under Roman rule. If he would have been a war-like revolutionary, you wouldn't even know his name, because he would've been executed the moment he was perceived as a threat. This is not so for Muhammad. Muhammad was born into an area that lacked a real authoritative presence, but rather sat on the sidelines to a large war between two great empires: the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanian Empire. Muhammad led a pretty hard life, and became a hard man. He had multiple religious revelations wherein he revealed to his followers the spoken word of God. As a manner of proving that God stood behind him, he promised to deliver his followers from the inter-tribe wars and constant nomadic way of life that the members of this part of the world endured. And he did. Through war. Muhammad and the Caliphs (think like Emperors) that followed him built an empire. The key difference, however, is that Christianity was born through nonviolence, whereas Islam was born through war."
t3_1wmoca,cf3hjc2,"I think you've got two CMVs here: the one in your title and the one in your description. The one in your title is a generalization about people and should be pretty easy to change - people have different priorities, and a lot of priorities have college as a prerequisite (law for instance). On the second one, why should you go to college - well, in the field of music there are a ton of specialties that you won't really be able to develop if you don't at least take some classes (sound engineering comes to mind). In college, you'll be exposed to professionals in your field. Maybe your professor will know people from famous bands and would be able to hook you up with an awesome mentor. Maybe your school has a pub and pays students to do gigs there. Maybe the music department has a full blown recording studio that they rent out to students for free. See, you have this idea in your head about college being this ""thing"" that's the same everywhere. You're thinking college is like high school. Well, it's not. There are hundreds and hundreds of colleges to choose from, each with their own perks, strengths, and costs. You can pick the one you want to go to, you can make that decision based on its faculty, and the classes it offers, and its location, and its facilities, etc. In order to have the most number of options, however, you need to have that baseline: GPA + SATs."

We can refer to this as a dynamical system, that is the whole universe is rearranged continuously by mathematical functions acting on it. The thing with this universal system is that it is chaotic. Being ""chaotic"" has a very precise mathematical sense, and while it is quite technical, I will focus on one very important aspect : For any initial state X at time t, there is another initial state Y arbitrarily close to the first one, the evolution of X will be arbitrarily far from the evolution of Y after some finite time T. This means that however close to X I restrict my search, I will still find such a Y that after some finite time we can distinguish both as being ""different""."

This means that however close to X I restrict my search, I will still find such a Y that after some finite time we can distinguish both as being ""different"". This property is called ""Heavy dependance on initial conditions"". Now, one could say that even though we don't know the initial conditions, there have been set in stone and that's what they are. It is here that quantum mechanics come into play. One of the postulate of quantum mechanics is that infinitesimal particles do not exist in a specific state, they have a probability density of being in specific states. This means, in some sense, that they actually are in all of those states at the same time. It is also proven that it is impossible to know both the precise speed and the precise position of small particles at the same time, and by ""know"" I do not mean measure, I mean that if one is known, the other actually takes multiple values at the same time, with a given probability associated to each. While I found this to be hardly believable at the beginning, it has stood the test of experimentation. How does this relate to the universe being chaotic? If for small particles initial conditions are not determined precisely, then the future cannot be determined precisely. From a physical perspective, not a measuring perspective. And another property of chaotic dynamical systems is that for any initial state X, among those arbitralily close to it I can find another one Y that will be arbitrarily close to any other state Z in some finite time. This means that not only is the universe not determined (precisely because of the mathematical functions that define it), a small change in initial conditions can eventually change everything. Now, the interactions in our brain happen on the quantum scale (or, at least, some of them do). This means that even on the scale of the brain, things are not deterministic. Hence, free will. In short, there is actually a mathematical function. The problem is not that we cannot compute it, it is that this very mathematical function and the fabric of our universe tells us that it is actually not deterministic. EDIT: All right, I shouldn't have said that non determinism implies free will, and in light of all your replies, I see how this is the case. However, to everyone who tells me that my examples are not relevant to non determinism, I was merely finding a counterexample, a small dent in the fact that everything was determined because we could represent everything by a mathematical function. I didn't really think through all the later implications, simply the fact that the principle of incertitude make initial (or stopping, by stopping I mean ""at a given time"") conditions impossible to know, from a physical point of view. Normally, for me, a counterexample, however small it is, is enough to throw entire theories down, or at least give a need to patch it."
t3_1w91jl,cezwkl3,"I understand that you don't wish to have the source of the culture argued to you and that you really just want to be able to objectively look at the cultures and deem one the higher-valued. Unfortunately, I don't think this is actually possible. The nature of poor black culture (this is what I assume you are speaking of), and the nature of any other culture for that matter, is inextricable from its setting. If you were to incorporate mainstream culture into every walk of poor black life, many people would end up worse off than they are now as the structural factors prohibiting many poor blacks from leading a ""mainstream life"" would not change. Schools would still be drastically underfunded, jobs would still not be open to them, and they would still have to make due at the bottom of the pyramid using less than admirable methods. Taking this into consideration, poor black culture evidently developed in part to meet the specific needs of a oligarcho-capitalist society's most disadvantaged, so in this regard, it is superior to mainstream culture when practiced by those at the bottom. In example, snitching is taboo in that it jeopardizes the livelihoods and futures of the members of one's community. On average, blacks receive much longer sentences than justified and a majority of poor black males will spend time in prison, meaning that local economies are constantly under fire and contributing to that by snitching only makes things worse. There are parts of it, however, that I question when it comes to their benefit, such as the misogyny."
t3_1vil80,cet0nf1,"I just wanted to point out that your idea of this ""outside area of land"" is itself essentially predicated on the existence of society, as you seem to want the society in question to essentially cordon off this land as protected and stateless.

If you do not want any sort of protection of this status, however, then in what way will this land remain free and stateless?"
t3_1tt75b,cebccgh,"It seems as though every qualm you have sited about the sport of basketball stems from the pace of the game. Every single possession in basketball must end with a missed basket, a turnover, or points all within a 24 second period; because of this fast-paced aspect of the game, the opportunities to score are greatly increased especially when taking into consideration the size of the playing field is 94' x 50', which, needless to say, doesn't even come close to the football field, baseball field, or soccer pitch. Hence, there is an urgency to score points as the window in which to score is greatly reduced per possession and the offensive team is essentially immediately placed in front of the spot where points are scored. Imagine if every football possession started on the 20-yard line of the defensive team and the offense had 1 minute to score. So, you are right, there are lots of points scored, but that is the nature of the game. If there was no shot clock and no urgency to shoot and score points it is almost guaranteed that the scores would be a lot lower. However, because of the high rate of scoring, basketball becomes more about a game of momentum. When teams string together successful possessions with 8-0 runs two aspects of the game are affected simultaneously and noticeably. From one team's perspective, they are not making shots due to poor offense with turnovers and/or missed shots while playing poor defense and not stopping the other team. Other sports don't necessarily have this level of perceptible momentum that readily is observed through the scoreboard. Football does have these swings in momentum, but it often takes a considerable amount of time to produce results on the scoreboard as the field is so large and scoring comes at a much slower clip as each PLAY is within 35 seconds whereas each SCORE in basketball is within 24 seconds. Many games are decided within 2 or 3 points; 2 or 3 baskets. But I hardly think that is any reason to disregard the rest of the points scored. When a score is tied 90-90 with 2 minutes left it has to be thought of as this: Each team has been able to respond to each others offensive and defensive plays and stops. In relation to baseball, every out recorded was met by the other team, and every run was met with one of one's own. But if a game is tied 2-2 in the 8th should we erase everything that happened in innings 1-7? Your argument of the value of each score is completely valid; however, a basketball team with the ball with 10 seconds left in a tie game has just as every respective opportunity to win as a baseball team tied with its opponent with 3 outs in the bottom of the ninth."
t3_1sgl5a,cdy0hcv,"I agree with you that the history books that we read in school are biased, and curiously, contain no event that occurred post-1947. I think to understand the importance of Gandhi, you ought to read a book by Ramachandra Guha called India After Gandhi. Guha describes the teething problems that we had as a nation and the role that Nehru played in keeping it together. He argues that without a well-loved person at the helm, India would have fallen apart. Sitting here in 2013, we take for granted that India as a country always existed, and would have gotten her freedom eventually, but I disagree. India did not exist except on British maps . We were not one nation in 1947, though we may be (sort of) today. We were a collection of many, many different peoples, across radically diverse geography. We couldn't even communicate with each other, because in many cases because people didn't speak a common language. Nations usually have a common language or religion that ties them together and any nation today has either one or both of these two as a uniting factor.

t3_1s8zmg,cdwf8t8,"The problem has nothing to do with biology. (Well, it does, but not in this specific argument.) While I personally have no moral qualms with abortion, I'd like to address the premise of this logic as opposed to the argument. I believe that being pro-life is a morally valid position to have, IF and only if the argument is consistent. I don't believe your argument is consistent here. You believe that abortion is morally wrong under regular circumstances, and equate it to murder - ""take a life."" However, you do say that you believe the only permissible reason to do so would be to save one or more lives. If the situation were that the baby would not have survived the pregnancy anyway and also would harm the mother's life, then I would argue that it is not murder. However, if the situation were that the baby would survive, but kill the mother in the process, then your argument doesn't make sense to me. If only one life is being saved (the mother's) and you consider the fetus to have a life, what makes the fetus' life worth less than that of the mother's? And who is the mother to decide? (Just because she is the only one who can decide, does that make her morally sound in whatever choice she makes?) I suppose you could equate it to self defense: (""This one individual was threatening my life, and therefore it was within moral correctness for me to kill them, as it was the only way to stop the threat."") However, this logic seems flawed to me as well, because a fetus cannot have a malicious intent to harm you. Perhaps a more apt representation was would be: ""This individual's existence threatens mine, and therefore it was within moral correctness for me to kill them, as it was the only way to stop the threat."" In this view however, you must consider that it must be unfair then, for a one individual to decide who of the two will be able to continue living."

From their point of view, it was as logical as someone today concluding that they have a dead battery if their car won't turn over. Ah crap, time to find someone who can give me a jump. When people accept religious concepts as deep and immutable facts it's just like growing up and taking oxygen for granted.

If there is something glaringly unlikable about your personality, PUA will not get you out of addressing it. PUA might get you interest, it might get you a second date, it might even get you laid sometimes, but at some point a woman is going to wake up and get hit full-force with whatever is putting everybody else off to begin with, and if God help you you actually like her, at that point there will be a reckoning way more painful for you than the constant rejection you face now.

Politicians obviously advise business, think tanks and academics before making choices, it would be undemocratic to do otherwise - that is termed 'making a decision in a vacuum' and is considered a dumb thing to do. Secondly, I was actually quite disappointed by the recent plenum of the communist party primarily because it failed to address several issues that will effect the economic success of China in the long run. When China decided to open its economy up to market forces decades ago, it made sense to be an export driven player in what was becoming a globalized market. However for China to succeed in the future it needs to modernize and focus on growing the domestic market by empowering its consumers. You talked about granting more property rights to farmers/rural folk which is good, the government also decided to deregulate some investment vehicles (because quite frankly all those ghost towns are embarrassing), strengthen social security and create a more independent judiciary (as an aside: does that sound very technocratic to you?).

t3_1pv4f2,cd6ia67,"Hi citadelspace. Let's see if I can change your view. It comes down to three things in my mind: The number of people that may be offended, be reminded of a horrific/traumatic event, or be angered by the comments

 The percent chance that someone will be offended, be reminded of a horrific/traumatic event, or be angered by the comments The intensity of offense/anger/horror/trauma/flashbacks that will be elicited by the comments

The higher each goes, the less sense it would make for you to tell it. Let's look at a few examples:

Suppose a white comedian went on stage throwing around the N-word and joking that black people love getting into crime and doing drugs. As you can imagine, the chance of offense is high, the number of people will be offended (many black people) is high, and the amount of offense is high. As such, I think it's reasonable that comedians should think twice before making such jokes. Suppose a comedian was making jokes about PTSD and killing others in wars and how they must be pussies when they come back home. The number of people that might be offended is lower (soldiers and their close friends/family) however the chance of offense as well as the intensity are very high."

There's a saying that you can take the boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy. Not to say there on a few exceptions, but generally speaking those less productive people who depend on government assistance tend to raise kids with similar values. I would argue that society needs more people that are good parents of the children, not simply more children. Some parents don't give a damn, and the children run loose unsupervised. The kids basically raise themselves . Anybody can get a girl knocked up, but only a real man does the hard daily work of parenting, guarding, and supervising child.

Many people decide to abuse it for years so they enroll in a university solely for benefits, therefore they don't actually attend classes. Because of the crisis the government can't spend the same amounts of money for education, so they decided to cut teachers salaries. Consequently many of them became overburdened with responsibilities and extremely unhappy with their position, which decreased the quality of education.

The short explanation is that the increased efficiency of the components carried more than offsets the extra weight, and the extra weight allows things to be done very differently. The first thing to understand is that most cars use the URL . Hybrids, however, make use of the URL . Compared to the Otto cycle, the Atkinson cycle is able to achieve much greater fuel efficiency. However, that efficiency comes at the expense of power. Enter the electric motor - electric motors can deliver maximum torque from 0 RPM, which can be used to counterbalance the loss of power in an Atkinson cycle engine. The electric motor also has the benefit of being able to convert both electrical energy to kinetic energy, and vice versa - that is, it can be used to recover energy while braking, whereas conventional car braking setups cannot. This is another point in which hybrids beat conventional cars for efficiency. Finally, the battery. By running the engine at a slightly higher power than immediately demanded, as well as recapturing energy from braking, the battery enables the electric motor to be used to help even the load on the gasoline engine - as engines get up to the higher end of the power curve and approach 100% power output, their efficiency tends to suffer as a result. By using the electric motor to balance the power demand, you can offload some of the energy to the electric motor, and allow the motor to run at a more efficient RPM for a greater amount of time. Certainly, if you need to accelerate hard, you'll end up demanding 100% power output from both motors, but that scenario accounts for a tiny minority of driving. Most times, acceleration does not require such a dramatic output in power, and cruising even less so. In these, the majority of driving scenarios, the load balancing between the two results in further increased efficiency. Also, your concerns about the motor and the battery being ""very heavy"" are rather exaggerated - a Gen 3 Prius' battery weighs URL . I don't have any number on how much the Prius' electric motor weighs; however, given that the Nissan Leaf's 80 kw motor weighs URL , and that the Prius' electric motor maximum output is URL , it would be fair to conclude that the overall hybrid setup would add about 200 pounds to a car's weight (motor, battery and all), which is certainly far from crippling for efficiency."

The main argument of the STEM field side seems to be that the purpose of higher education and of the college major is vocational training. With the exception of very specific and focused degrees, I would argue that this isn't the case. As I've seen it, the purpose of higher education is to teach an individual to think in certain ways. Take for example a course in math. Most colleges require quite a bit of math for an engineering major. Much of this education is either tangentially relevant or applicably useless given the current ability of calculators and programs such as Wolfram Alpha. Even for someone majoring in math and thinking of pursuing a PHD, many of the courses they take will be less than relevant given the incredibly specific nature of mathematical research. The purpose instead is to teach the kind of critical thinking and problem solving abilities that would be useful in the field. While I think the introduction to a field is definitely helpful, it's certainly not critical. You will see liberal arts and humanities majors in design firms and STEM fields. In many of those positions the ability to write eloquently and argue your position might be just as useful as technical knowledge. You see a lot of colleges nowadays stressing writing skills within their engineering program. One of the best ways to describe this is with the missile analogy. Let's say you're an engineer at the pentagon working on missile designs. You're incredibly knowledgeable about airflow, fin design, and motor design. Maybe your boss understands cares about these things. His boss however is only concerned about three things, how far the missile goes, how fast it goes, and how big a whole it will make when it hits."

Obama made no comment about Zimmerman being guilty. Most of his comments were to the effect of ""let's figure out what happened"" and ""I hope the justice system gets to the bottom of this."" He was not saying ""I hope Zimmerman has to pay for this"" or ""I hope he goes to jail."" He clearly did not take sides in this trial, made even more obvious by the qualifications he makes when beginning his response.

This is the approach that the president took. He did not comment on Zimmerman's guilt.

t3_1ia3zd,cb2qsg6,"Sorry to hear about your response. I know all too well how that goes. Anyhow, you said: How do you think Latin, a relatively 'global' language at one time, split into the multitudes of languages that we call the Romance family? French, Italian, Romanian, etc. all started as regional dialects that changed past the point of mutual intelligibility. While it is true that English is rapidly becoming a global language of sorts, it is not necessarily accurate to think of it as a single global language. text , as they're called, are the result of a sort of linguistic colonialism in which the English language is (mostly or soon-to-be) universally known, but is not the same everywhere that it's spoken. Different cultures place different values on English and use it for different reasons. Even if we assume that the world is headed towards some kind of monoculture, things like economic class or occupation will divide people by their associations, and when people are divided, language likewise divides. What, in my opinion, is likely to happen in this case, is the emergence of one English that is used for official purposes, and many descendants of English being used by different groups, however they end up being defined."
t3_1i6m7q,cb1isj1,"I fully agree that the education system needs to change, and your idea does make improvements. However, I believe that school serves a purpose besides education. It teaches students how to socialize and behave in society. In your theoretical system, every student wouldn't really have peers because students learn at different rates for different subjects. It might cause students to lag behind on purpose to stay with some friends or cause really gifted students to never really make friends especially at the younger ages. Growing up, I was normally placed in advance classes and I learned a great deal, however it did stagnate my social skills greatly."
t3_1ht05v,caxvc7y,"It's this premise that seems a bit weak. It smacks of URL ; Kant promised the king of Prussia, Frederick William II, that he wouldn't publish any more criticisms of religion. When the king died, Kant resumed his attack on religion. In Kant's view only promises made to people had any normative force, so when the person he made his promise to became a corpse (not a person), Kant considered himself absolved of his moral duty. Most non-Kantians (and many Kantians as well) believe this argument fails. The normative force of promises is derived from the duty to respect the autonomy of the subject of the promise (breaking a promise is a kind of lie, and lying violates autonomy), but how can you say you're respecting a person's autonomy when you fully intend to break your promise to them sometime in the future? This is evidence that the autonomy of once-living persons carries at least some normative force after they are dead. We can easily see how this relates to cannibalism; unless you have some good reason to believe a person wants to be cannibalized, based on general attitudes toward cannibalism we can assume a person does not want their body to be cannibalized after they die, and to do so would represent Consensual cannibalism may be morally permissible, however it would be so rare that the only way to effectively regulate it is to criminalize it, and place the burden of proof of consent on any would-be cannibals."
t3_1hajga,casiuzy,"I get the impression you're assuming the women who will be in these front line positions will entirely consist of women who are there to break the glass ceiling specifically to wave the flag of equality. Since we have a volunteer military(and not just in the Army, but all branches) there will presumably be a variety of women entering recruitment offices. Some of these will be more physically fit than others, some will have better analytical minds. That is exactly the same case as men, and while recruiters certainly have their quotas to meet the services do speak with one another(their offices are often in the same shopping centers right next to one another), ideally helping to place those candidates better suited for one kind of service(both mentally and physically) in that billet. While you're absolutely right the PFTs have different standards for men and women, I think you're making a 1:1 comparison of these fitness requirements to effectiveness in combat situations which I believe to be fallacious. Those standards are meant to test three metrics as a gross measure of strength and endurance. Those benchmarks would most directly relate to is the ability to march for long periods of time with heavy gear on one's person. While this is less of an operational necessity in today's army, it's also important to note the scoring is averaged with minimums in every category, for men and women and have ranges specifically to accommodate varying degrees of strength and stamina, again, in both their male and female military members(soldiers in this case). I think your statement >Any reason other than budget cuts is a bullshit reason to make a fighting force less effective. is also fallacious because it assumes the position that women have been excluded from professional military forces because they are actually less effective rather than because of the assumption they are. Women historically were not hunters or warriors in classical societies because it was exceptionally rare for women not to fulfill domestic roles as well, thus giving less time to even become proficient at martial activities. As recognition and acceptance of variance from traditional gender roles has become more mainstream, previously conforming personalities are more free to choose lifestyles that are more physical and stereotypically 'male' than before. I think the mindset of women joining the army, especially those seeking out combat-prone positions, is going to be more like that of men seeking those same positions than you are giving them credit. I'm not going to make any arguments regarding any innate ingenuity or balance or other advantages females may have over men; I'm not familiar with documentation asserting one way or the other on those characteristics. However, to once again address the specific criticism of strength and size between the sexes, I'll quote from the Wikipedia article URL : I will make the argument that women aren't any less proficient, given comparable training as men, at the use of firearms and other combat tools. For URL , I agree that all things being equal in training and preparation and fighting style matching, the average male will be superior to an average women given that men are on average larger and stronger than women. However, to assume this is the common meeting of bodies is to also assume all enemy soldiers and our soldiers are of the same mould as if they're from an early era FPS game. It also neglects that URL include elements of URL , the heart of which is based on the concept of turning an opponent's superior size and strength against him or her, rendering them defeated instead by exploiting mass pain at joints as well as submission. In the case of an actual life or death situation there is no tap out, of course. The hold would simply be held long enough to render the enemy unconscious or dead. Male or female, proper training in technique is critical to having the upper hand in this situation. Regarding morale and cohesiveness of units, there are a great many things which can both bring together groups of people and fracture them apart. Religion, race, ethnicity, age, place of origin in the country are all deeply felt and have all played roles in both problems and solutions in the military. I'm not saying this is your position, but I've heard a similar accusation that men won't be at their optimum fighting state in the event a woman is around, as they'll be distracted or maybe there's going to be some sort of sexual tryst which distracts from missions at hand. I think this, at least superficially, sounds a lot like the argument against having homosexuals in the military and I think that is an assumption on the part of the character and actions of people we don't even know that we are apparently not making on the part of our faceless, monolithic group of acceptable male candidates that presumably make up the combat forces right now. Women can certainly still get pregnant, though even in the Navy it was more than a little bit recommended they choose to get an IUD to avoid this as it can, indeed, be a deep complication to their personal as well as their unit's readiness. I think the way to mitigate this problem, however, is not by simply outright banning women from combat positions, as this is a situation which affects people at every level and position in the military."

t3_1h5k81,cargoo8,"So, one issue that people run into in a conversation like this is that we tend break down the world along the disciplinary lines of the educational institutions in which we were raised. Thus, we think of religion as covering a domain of knowledge quite separate from that which is covered by literature, which is quite different from that of biology, which is different again from econ. One reason that I think your initial question is really useful and interesting is that calls our attention to the way religion and literature share massively overlapping projects: both seek to describe the way we distribute meaning throughout our lives by urging us to pay attention to certain features of the world. That religion does this is pretty clear (these behaviors are sins; these virtues), but literature does it, too: think of the way in which a Jane Austen novel teaches its heroines to view this person as marriageable and that person as not; or think of the way a Cold War spy thriller subtly suggests this kind of person (say, a bearded guy who has a habit of talking about the dangers of class is not to be trusted, whereas the Captain America looking corn-fed fellow is al right!). Religion, especially medieval Christianity used to have a lock on this shit (""No God but ME! ""), but nowadays, a number of different, overlapping explanatory regimes exist (as can be seen in the way that Austen's heroines seek matches who are both ethical and handsome, i.e. good biological mates, in addition to ethically good; or the way that the spy thriller encourages you to think that this person's economic policies are, to make a mild conflation, sinful). I think that literature, if taught properly, is really about the (nowadays largely secular) ways that we make and distribute meaning in our lives. Thought of so generally, the different disciplinary arena don't seem so closed off from one another. So, even if one doesn't buy into Christianity (as I don't), one might think that that Aristotle dude had some pretty sharp ideas (as I do) and realize that most of the effect that Aristotle has had on the world has been via Aquinas, and that, therefore, if I want to talk about the Aristotelian distinction between form and content in literature, that many (especially older) literary works, and some of my more religious students, will frame that distinction as paralleling the relation between the material substance of the Son and the ideal substance of the Father. The problem with framing such meaning making as a fundamentally religious question is that religion in general, and Christianity in particular usually presents itself not as an answer, not as one partial explanation , but as a totalizing and exclusive explanation (what Northorp Frye, himself a devout Christian, referred to as an apocalyptic symbolic regime). By contrast, most smart teachers within an individual secular discipline acknowledge the limited explanatory power of what they teach (though they'll also argue that their discipline has more explanatory power than it's usually given credit for--gotta be defending one's turf, right?). It's hard, though, to present Christianity in such a limited fashion, and I think it's particularly hard for kids in high school to grasp it, since they're likely still living at home and are probably forced to conform their religious practices to those of the family in which they were raised. For high school kids (and even a lot of the college kids I teach at one of the most prestigious universities on earth), there are very real, practical ways in which religion is the totalizing force it claims to be. This is particularly true in small town America. It's hard for a kid who's only ever known a small, almost exclusively Christian social milieu to see a religion as something that is meant to teach partial truths or to have limited explanatory power. By the time you move on to college, however, you're hopefully beginning to see that even religious institutions can be provisional."

Your main point is really interesting though. I meant to tailor my response more to your question, but honestly I got sidetracked in my comment and started to ramble a bit.

t3_1go0nk,cam94e3,"URL . Qualia are the highlights of conscious experience. The experience of the color red. The pain of a cut. The sound of a crash. I know that I experience these things. When I pinch my arm, my nervous system carries a signal to my brain that notifies it of the stimulus. But there is something additional: an actual experience of the pain. This experience is a quale. The philosopher David Chalmers has a thought-experiment that really highlights this, involving what he calls URL . In short, imagine a world just like our own, down to every last quark and gluon. When you pinch me, I say ""Ow!"". I can sit and watch a sunset, and remark that the sky is purple. But unlike our world, in this new world I never actually experience anything. This seems totally possible. After all, reacting to a pinch only requires the transmission of the stimulus to the brain, not a conscious experience. So his argument is this: Let's suppose that the physical description of our world accounts for everything. This view is called physicalism , and though you didn't explicitly endorse it in your post, it is quite likely similar to the opinion you seem to hold. URL has a more thorough form of the argument, if you are interested. So now we have two worlds that are physically identical, down to every last detail. But in one world, we have conscious experience, and in the other we don't. So it cannot possibly be that the physical description of the world accounts for everything in it: for one, it doesn't account for consciousness. Thus physicalism must be false. This argument is logically valid, but some people take issue with some of the premises. For one, it is possible that a complete physical description of the world would account for consciousness, therefore it would be logically impossible for an exact physical clone of our universe to be missing conscious experience. Much has been written about this specific argument, both in favor and in opposition. I'd like to return, though, to qualia. Any worldview has to account for qualia. For entirely physical worldviews, this means that qualia ultimately are physical. There are some famous arguments, however, that try and show that this cannot be so."
t3_1gndd7,calwfp3,"Can I say to begin with that I really like the idea you had of stating under which conditions you will award a delta - it really helps shape the discussion towards the key points you want to be considered. If you don't mind a miniature appeal to authority, I work in a field where philosophical sophistication is absolutely paramount, and so I want to give you some examples of the kinds of questions I would have to answer on a daily basis, and perhaps we can move the argument forward by ascribing one or more of your 'fallacious trivialities' to these problems. I'll try and order them roughly in terms of 'most hard to assign a triviality' to 'least hard to assign a triviality'. At what rate should we trade public health for individual liberties? I notice that - in general - your list is very light on political philosophy. Certainly, we could argue that 'individual liberty' is an artifact of human intuition, but I feel that this is an inadequate response - people's liberty  means* something to them, and professional philosophers have taken upon themselves the onerous task of describing exactly what that meaning is Under what circumstances are people unable to meaningful consent to medical procedures? Once again, people's capacity to consent  means* something to them. Even if you argue that consent is something which only exists in the context of a society (and I don't think this is true at all), it is absolutely a non-trivial problem to engage in meta-reasoning and describe the rules with which we ascribe consent What does it mean for a patient to 'understand' the risks of a medical procedure? You refute the question 'what is knowledge?' by arguing that it is nebulous, and without clear boundaries. OK, I think I agree (but for different reasons). However the question, ""Does X know/understand proposition Y?"" is different, and important, because it precisely probes the nature of those boundaries. What is 'health'? You'll probably hit this with a 1.1 objection (or maybe a 1.2). To a professional in my field, however, this isn't good enough; we have to be able to approximate 'health' mathematically, so the question becomes philosophically interesting once more - ""Is 'health' more like X or Y?""."
t3_1g8tam,cahvvfw,"Well, just because they aren't a legal resident doesn't mean they don't pay any taxes. Of the 12 million, about 9 million pay some form of income tax, the IRS even has a special form for people to file taxes without the government being able to then come after them for being undocumented. That also doesn't count sales tax, property tax, gas tax, cigarette/alcohol tax, these are very big parts of funding local schools and health care. That also doesn't factor in the economic benefit they have by creating demand for goods and services, and providing a cheap source of labor which make things cheaper for everyone. But the reason so many come here is not for our services but our opportunity . Guatamala for example has an average income that is equivalent (when adjusted for cost of living) to making $5,200 in the US before taxes. If you work 60h/week, 50 weeks a year, that's the equivalent of being paid $1.73/h. The average hourly wage for undocumented workers are around $3.75/h, that's more than double what they make at home even when you factor in higher cost of living. It's closer to tripple if you don't factor in cost of living. They are coming to the US the same reason our parents or grand parents did, for the chance at a better life than they had in their home country. Edit: And lastly, there's a reason Americans get these services. Universal education is good for everyone because then people aren't illiterate (and therefore not able to be productive). Emergency healthcare is good for everyone because then people who could otherwise continue to live and be productive aren't dead from preventable deaths. Fire and police protection is good, because ignoring either one can have spillover affects for the whole city. It isn't just a moral obligation, that can be debated. It is however in the economic best interests of everyone to provide basic services to non-citizens for the same reason it's in our economic best interest to provide services to citizens."
t3_1fzbuj,cafam2z,"I have three basic ways of explaining my taste in music to people: ""the spicy food approach"": Do you like spicy food? And I don't mean the painfully hot stuff, which is more of a fringe thing, I just mean stuff like the mild hotness of BBQ sauce or medium salsa on your chips. You would think, if spicy food had never been invented, that the concept of intentionally making your food painful to eat (even in small amounts) would be something exactly 0% of people enjoy. But in reality, most people  do* enjoy some amount of spiciness, mostly because it makes food more interesting, or because it provides a greater range of ingredients to work with. I see heaviness in music as being roughly analogous to spiciness in food: some people simply find it painful to eat something and can't fathom why you would deliberately add food that makes eating painful, while others would have it no other way, and get hooked to spicier and spicier foods, each food providing a bigger thrill than the last. Everyone has a different spiciness threshold, like they do in music, before which spice is enjoyable and beyond which it simply becomes painful. Music is the exact same way, and what you consider unmusical noise is exactly the thing someone else gets a rush of adrenaline from. The ""everything can be done properly or badly"" approach: Vocals in death metal are, admittedly, not used the same way vocals are used in most other kinds of music. They provide a more rhythmic component and tie the instruments together. You linked us to Cannibal Corpse, which is heavier than the example I'll use, but listen to [Take This Life, by In Flames](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1FkbvGl-IU). Listen all the way up to the chorus, and feel free to stop the song about 2 minutes in. So... not very melodic, right (granted, the vocals are a little more musical than the Cannibal Corpse song you linked, but I can't find acoustic Cannibal Corpse :P)? Now listen to some guy who deconstructed the guitar riffs, the screaming, and everything else in the song and is playing the [song on an acoustic guitar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwRsXQs2oc). Someone who listens to a lot of metal, like me, hears the same subtleties in the screamed vocals that this guy based his acoustic version on. It's there, you just have to enjoy it enough to hear it. Now, that said, there are good death metal vocalists and bad ones. Everyone has their favourites, and there are lots of good ones who have different styles. If you just go and pick some random death metal album that nobody's ever heard of and try to pick up on subtle vocal dynamics, I'm not saying you'll find them. But then if you listen to some of the best singers, you will see them directing the song in many of the exact same ways that a traditional singer does it, just in an extremely different style. Off the top of my head, one example of really good death metal singing is [Lamb of God-Redneck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdZpxkzNvc). the ""Are drums music?"" approach: Not every instrument is there to fill the same role. In a typical blues/rock/pop/metal band, you have basically the same setup: one to three guitars (three live guitars is rare, but there are almost always at least 3 guitars in recorded music), a bass, a drummer, and a singer. Many bands have keyboardists, some have other instruments like trumpets or saxophones, but for the most part that's it - a band composed of 2 guitarists, a singer, a drummer, and a bassist can play pretty much anything from Chuck Berry to Cannibal Corpse to Adele. But the way each instrument is used in each genre is radically different, as is the ideal sound (or tone) of each instrument. You could play Chuck Berry on the same guitar you play Cannibal Corpse on, with the same setup, but it'll be hard to find a tone that works well on both. You could play some Red Hot Chili Peppers on the same bass that you play Adele, but again, the ideal bass sound and playstyle are so different for both those artists that it almost isn't the same instrument. Instruments play different roles in different styles: to play Adele you barely want to hear the guitar, while if you're playing Jimi Hendrix the guitar provides a beautiful wall of fuzzy noise weaving in and out of the vocals. Similarly you wouldn't sing Aretha Franklin the same way you would sing Adele, even if they're both powerful female vocalists. But wherever the melody comes from, the drums sit back and provide rhythm. If you heard just the drum track from the greatest hits of the last century (however you define them), you would probably recognize less than 5% of the songs."
t3_1fl90i,cabjfyp,"First, your definition of ""secular"" is incorrect. In terms of government, a secular government isn't one that disregards arguments on religious grounds, it is a government that derives it's power from a temporal source, rather than a spiritual one. For example, the Republic of Ireland is a secular state because it's president is elected by the people and his power comes from a mandate bestowed upon him by the electorate. Ireland, however, does accept arguments made on a religious basis as over 80% of it's population is Catholic."

Ireland, however, does accept arguments made on a religious basis as over 80% of it's population is Catholic. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, is not a secular state as the monarch derives her authority from God (hence ""God and my right""). So the secularism of a state is in no way linked to the kinds of laws they make regarding religious freedoms (the UK and Iran are not secular states that take vastly different approaches to religious freedoms). Second, the United States is famously a secular state but it is rife with religious justification for laws (though, not regarding the right to worship). It is also institutionally Christian - the US president swears an oath on the Bible, the pledge of allegiance cites union under God and the national motto is ""In God We Trust"". In spite of this and it's overwhelmingly Christian population, the US has yet to bar worship of any religion. So far we see that while a given state may be officially or unofficially secular, this has no bearing on a) it's capacity or willingness to accept religious argument as a basis for legislation and b) just because a state legislates in line with a particular religion's belief's doesn't mean that it will begin to encroach on the right to worship - though the rights of non worshipers suffer, discussed below. The last point I want to make is the one you raise about being part of a minority. Minorities aren't always at a disadvantage. Syria for example, has been dominated by the Alawites since 1970. Assuming however, that we are talking about a stable representative democracy then often minorities find themselves vulnerable - this is why documents like the Bill of Rights get written, and why the power of the majority gets kept in check with bicameral government and veto powers."
t3_1fdu9t,ca9jfv7,"I'm interested in your conception of ""natural."" If you're implying that all that's natural is good, I think you may have to reconsider. Think about diseases, which are quite prevalent in nature, that we have banished, or made less serious, with medicine, much of which is certainly not ""natural."" It is true that there is a food chain, clearly defined, that is very ""natural."" However, one could argue that raising animals for food isn't very natural, besides certain kinds of ants, human beings are the only species that do it. Once more, raising certain kinds of animals creates byproducts that are harmful to the environment (Cows, general shipping for meat and fish and such). I am not a vegan, and I do consume meat. I can, however, see why many vegans would choose their lifestyle."
t3_1f9oa8,ca8jm6c,"This is incorrect. Scientific theories can be wrong, and they can be improved. But our understanding won't literally reverse from our current understanding. Newtonian physics isn't false because of Einsteinian physics; there are just places where Einsteinian physics is more accurate. The next great theory will build on Einstein, not demolish him. I don't understand how you could think this. All modern detection is based on the scientific process. We ask ourselves whether a person could have committed a crime and then attempt to prove or disprove that claim with scientific reasoning. This is literally the cornerstone of the modern adversarial justice system. Respect for the human life doesn't determine that a fetus is a person (which, again, does need to be shown through the scientific process to establish a charge of murder). This is a lot of your personal philosophy coming in here, that I don't know enough about to debate. But I'm not ignoring my conscience at all. It might surprise you to learn at this stage in the argument that I'm morally against abortion - I still disagree with your arguments. The scientific mind can, however, differentiate between a potential human and an actual human."

For instance, I'd support a requirement that concealed carry permittees be required to take an annual or semi-annual class (including range tests). The vast majority of attackers do not set out to kill, the threat of death is merely a tool they employ toward some other end. By increasing the risk facing an attacker from ""maybe I'll get caught by the police at some later date"" to ""I could die right there"" does change the thought process. URL EDIT: After I posted this, you edited your post RE non-lethal options. Many of the effective non-lethal or less-lethal weapons are illegal to possess. Pepper spray, for instance, is ineffective against people who already have an affinity for capsaicin, such as my family. My sister, who in her training for a federal law enforcement agency, was sprayed with standard-police-issue pepper spray - and was relatively unaffected - indeed was still able to pass a firearm accuracy test. Police issue pepper spray is quite a bit more potent than civilian grade. Stun-guns are hard to use, and totally ineffective at range. I will concede, however, that for short range combat (under 10 feet), a knife would potentially be a better weapon to have than a gun."

This is why the energy concentrations are called strings: imagine looking at a string from far away. It would look like a line, i.e. a 2D object. Then, once you get close enough, you can see the tiny third dimension which is the radius of this line. Now you can see it as a 3D object. Imagine this, but for non-spatial dimensions. That is the mathematical model of string theory for the most part, although obviously without the math!

t3_1a23ma,c8tf0xk,"You make a lot of assumptions about a lot of things, but I don't really want to get into those. Instead, I want to address your ""survive or die"" premise. People are good at surviving. It's basically what we're built to do, along with reproduction. And that doesn't just mean in a ""live in the woods and kill your own food"" sense; humans are resourceful, creative, and driven to preserve their own existence. The purpose of the welfare system is not to keep people alive, it's to elevate people from the basest levels of poverty and ensure that (most) everyone in our society lives with some basic quality of life. If you remove the welfare system, what happens? When the welfare is removed, these poor have three options, in order of desirability: 1. Find a job and work (often not possible because jobs are not always available, and very few managers want to hire homeless or near-homeless employees with few skills). They then have a stream of income and, according to you, do great. 2. Become homeless and scavenge, busk, or rely on charitable organizations to survive. There will never be a shortage of people willing to help those less fortunate, and there will never not be something that someone's discarded to scavenge from, so these people will eek out the barest of livings living on the streets, which will create problems for most urban centers. 3. Resort to crime. Remember, each of us wants to survive. When life gets tough enough, and you start to get desperate enough, it gets really tempting to just take what you need. If you get away with it, you stay alive until you have to steal/mug/prostitute yourself/etc. again. If you don't, you get caught and go live in a prison cell, with free food, shelter, and medicine provided by the government until your time's up and they toss you back out on the streets where, presumably, you begin to steal again. In both cases, crime rates rise. In no scenario do the poor (in keeping with your premise, the ""poor"" I'm referring to don't work and live entirely off welfare) all die off in droves, because they want to survive and will find a way to do so. Sure some of them will die--of curable diseases, exposure, malnutrition, etc.--but most will not. So what your proposal results in is this: Most poor people become homeless or live on the verges of homelessness, eking out a living however they can."

Secondly, that all other immigrants are either boat people or refugees. That's simply not true. Plenty of Asians or Indians come from relatively rich families. I can't speak to specifically about the Indian community, but I know the Asian community in my city is way richer (and have ties to richer countries) than the average black community. There's also a very specific subset of people that leave their country: those ""rich"" enough to leave. This means the average immigrant population will tend to do better (because only the better ones are coming). Finally, that the situation of immigrants and African Americans are equivalent or at least easily comparable. They're not. Immigrants arrive in a country for what they'd often consider a fresh start.

 Reduce the risk: some will undergo training, buy better equipment, research the activity etc. They recognise that the risk is high, so they attempt to reduce the possible outcome, the likelihood of occurrence, or both; * Transfer the risk: usually through insurance, people try to make the impact lower by transferring the liability to another body.

t3_333cqy,cqh6yao,"You sound very open minded and self aware of your situation. Props to you. Before anything else, I want to make a few things clear. First, there are several answers to each of your questions. I'll use the answer or answers I think are strongest, but you may want to do some additional research if you wish. Second, religion is largely faith based. I will warn you that some of the answers won't make much sense someone who isn't a believer. Hopefully I can do my best to appeal to your situation, but just keep this in mind. This is an age old question that has been debated for centuries. Below are some of the best arguments to answer a question that is incredibly difficult to answer. 1: Some Christians believe in creation based evolution. long story short, the Bible says things were created over the course of days. Some Christians interpret this as ""periods of time"" instead our normal 24 hour day. There's plenty of debate on this topic, so I encourage you to do some research. In terms of logic, this theory works pretty well. It doesn't dispute modern science like creation does. It can actually answer some questions that evolution has a hard time with, such as the origin of life. 2. If you do decide to research, DO NOT read anything by Ken Ham or the traditional creationists. Their arguments are made to address a Christian audience, not an agnostic one. EXAMPLE: I found this beauty of a quote from a well known creationist website: ""Did the flood really happen? Yes. Jesus said in Matt. 24:37-39 that the flood happened. If you can't trust Jesus, you can't trust anyone."" Be careful with the sources you choose... 3. Scientific theories can be false. Science can make mistakes, yet it seems like most people overlook this fact. Essentially, there's always a possibility of science being wrong, but at the same time, creation can be just as wrong. Not a strong argument, but something Christians believe in. 4. The general and classic arguments of complexity, origins of life, etc. I don't want to go into depth on these because they are fairly complicated and require some explanation. I would do some research on these issues, but please don't read one article and assume that all Christians believe the same thing. The answer to this won't be very satisfying, let me warn you. Ted Bundy was on death row for ~10 years. During that time, he reflected on his past decisions. URL he seems different. Is he doing this to look better in the public eye? Is he trying make himself feel better? We don't know. Christians believe that God is fair and just. We also believe that God judges everyone for what they do. For terrible, basic example, think of accepting Jesus as getting a ticket to a hotel. However, what you did during you life determines the quality of your room. Not satisfying, I know. In the same way, Bill Gates wouldn't get the ticket. An important thing to note about Christianity specifically is that it's not a works-based faith. I like to say that Christianity is a relationship, not a religion. The goal is to have a personal relationship with Jesus, period. This doesn't excuse your actions because you will still be judges in the end. Complicated and unsatisfying, I know. I've been there. I am in the minority of Christians who support gay rights. Although I don't agree with the idea of homosexuality, I do believe that we shouldn't discriminate based upon gender. Like question 1, this question has been tirelessly debated. Here's my answer to you. I know several gays who came to our church after several years of being in a relationship with other men. For whatever reason, they came back to the church and are trying to ""become straight"". Before I met these guys, my view of gays was pretty harsh. They made me realize the love I feel for women is the same love they feel for men. I can't imagine someone telling me that I can only love men. Anyway, these guys all have the same issues: They can't develop close relationships with other males because they might start loving them. They aren't attracted to women, so there's a very real chance they may never get married. Needless to say, they are all extremely unhappy. What would Jesus do? Yes, he says that being homosexual is a sin. However, he is fair. My question is this: Would Jesus want a depressed straight man or a happy homosexual? We don't know. That's how I rationalize it. Abortion is simpler to explain, yet harder to answer. I firmly believe that aborting a child is killing it. Whether it be alive in the womb or erasing the potential for life, abortion is murder to me. I am not opposed to abortions that stem from rape and domestic abuse. Even though I still think it's killing the baby, sometimes killing is permissible. Killing out of self defense is an example of this. Two responses: First, if you believe in Jesus and establish a personal relationship with him, it is easy to believe in his miracles. This argument is obviously towards people who are Christian/close to becoming one. Response two is specific evidence. It's pretty late, so I can't find the exact article. However, I do know of many atheist/agnostic arguments against the flood. The article I read takes each atheist point and rebuts against it with relative success. If you really want some answers, I would defiantly do some research on your own. Despite the onslaught of terrible Christian ""evidence"", there are some legitimate articles. Out of every argument against Christianity and religion in general, this is the most powerful one. There isn't a way to answer this with logic or reason. The only answer is to have faith. (Warning: I'm going to get very preachy, stay with me.) I've tried to refrain from answering your questions with the classic ""God works in mysterious ways"" and ""God can do anything!"". These rebuttals mean nothing to someone who doesn't believe. This question, however, needs that kind of answer."
t3_32br6b,cq9r1xc,"I have a couple of arguments for you. Government as neutral assessor/guaranteer of safety Most people agree that there is a role for government in inspecting food, drugs, products to ensure that what is promised is the same as what is delivered, and that consumers can expect a base level of quality. Strong libertarians will argue that the market will take care of this, but rather than see who dies of e coli and then boycotting the sources of the tainted food, proactive government monitoring makes sense to most people. To use your paragliding example, there's a role in monitoring and punishing a company that claims to use a titanium frame but actually uses a more failure-prone aluminum frame. The question is what happens when an inherently unsafe product is offered? Should a company be able to market a paper airplane you strap to your back, which has a 100% failure rate? I suppose the government could put on a label that says, ""Warning, use of this product will result in death"", but most people think that a product that is that inherently dangerous shouldn't be legal. After that point, it's really a question of where you draw the ""how dangerous is too dangerous"" line - including with recreational drugs. Whose life is it anyway If you are a single person living in a cabin in Montana, it really doesn't matter what you do as far as I'm concerned. But that's rarely the case. As a society, we have decided to have a safety net. If you scramble your brains ODing on some junk, society ma end up paying for your care for the rest of your life. We're going to pay for your kids. There's the cost to the guy who you crash into while driving high. Or when your addictions suck up all your money, again, we might be paying for your kids. Few actions ""don't hurt anyone else"" - and if society is impacted, your personal freedom has to be countered by the impact. EDIT I'm getting a number of responses about drug laws, alcohol, prescription drugs, etc. I want to reiterate, I'm not make a stand one way or another on drug legislation (although I think it's silly that pot is illegal and alcohol isn't), simply that there is a long established tradition of putting ""the overall good of society"" (however that is defined) over ""personal freedom"" (again, insert your definition here)."

t3_31cggh,cq0ni73,"I figured you might; that was merely an example of where some philosophers assert morality is derived from.

t3_31cggh,cq0p14t,"By this logic, more moral societies would always win out; a more fit animal or species always survives over less fit species in a state of nature - it's only the criteria that meet more fit that changes, not that proximate outcome. In practice, less moral societies have historically been able to impose their will on more moral societies; for a current events example you need look no further than the disruption of Ukraine's sovereignty by Russia and their proxy ""resistance"" fighters. I don't think anyone would argue that the invasion and disruption of a democratically elected government by a large, aggressive, and ultimately authoritarian power is a triumph of morality; I think it's far more accurate to say that the more pragmatic society tends to function better and survive longer than a more moral society. Practical and moral aren't the same, though, and rarely have been. I've played plenty of RTS games, though I'm more of a Civ or AoE man myself. As for slavery playing a large role in R:TW, this reflects the simple need for human labor in earlier eras; but if it was moral then, you wouldn't have the occasional upstart in every society (even those that base their entire economic models around slavery) that clearly advocates against the practice. If morality is at bottom just a way to make society work, then you'd have no such recognition of the basic inhumanity of enslaving another.

t3_30kxn3,cpu7c2g,"why not ask that about free speech? but to sum up since my post has been scattershot: a strong protection of negative liberty: the government doesn't necessarily have to give you anything to fulfill your religious beliefs but it can't stand in the doorway and prevent the exercise of your rights. now even negative rights conflict in extreme cases i.e. human sacrifice and there the right to life triumphs in part because the sacrificed doesn't have an obligation to give up her life (children's rights are the source of more interesting claim). tell me if i need to explain anything ********* why not look at the actual law: legitimate here meant true belief: however, your example misses the obvious point that no rights are really unrestricted."
t3_30a5zk,cpqjney,"So I think we can address by dividing this into three different categories, all of which are wholly non-binary. Note that this is not a comprehensive look at how things work, but I think it adequately addresses your confusion here. 1) Physicality - This is your sex. Whether you're born with a penis or a vagina or both. Note that the existence of the ""both"" means that this is not a binary thing. More or less, our society uses sex to determine gender. 2) Identity - This is your gender. Gender and sex are two very different things. For instance, I am a man and I have a penis. If, for some reason, I were to lose my penis in an accident of some kind, that would not stop me from being a man. I would still feel like a man in my mind, even though I am missing the instrument which our society (largely focused on binaries) says is necessary to be a man. Your gender identity exists in your mind. It is not determined by what exists between your legs. I also know some people who don't feel like a man or a woman, and prefer to be referred to by gender-neutral pronouns. 3) Expression - So we've talked about our physicality, our identity, and now we're going to talk about our behaviour. Remember, gendered behaviour is entirely socially constructed. In our hegemony, however, it is believed that behaviour is determined by gender, which is determined by sex."

t3_2yrgi3,cpcb5wt,"I'll approach this paragraph-by-paragraph, but I'm just going to quote the header you put on it for simplicity. Fitness standards can be changed. I agree that it's counterproductive to have fitness standards be less for women than men, but we just need to have an entirely non-discriminatory approach to this rather than keeping women from even having the chance to be discriminated against by excluding them altogether. The second article that you linked with reference to injuries also mentioned that the difference in injury rate dropped off significantly by the end of basic training, which I agree suggests that women statistically start off in worse shape but improve more during the session. Looking at the traditional societal relationship between athletics and sex, that makes sense to me. Let's just not have different standards, then. Yes, fewer women will qualify than men, but obviously these standards are in place to ensure that new recruits won't be a danger to themselves or others. I think that it would be reasonable to enact a form of mandatory birth control. Enforcing it is a more complex issue, but nowhere near impossible. There are long-term birth control methods that involve the URL that prevents ovulation. If I recall correctly, most hormonal birth control methods will also show up in urine tests (and certainly in blood tests), so that's a relatively simple enforcement tool. In the case of the subdural implant, however, you likely wouldn't need that since they aren't self-administered."

t3_2y1nt3,cp5nc7k,"I think this is a particularly inept example, because while most people do not understand math very well and so have trouble understanding what sorts of mathematical knowledge might depend on being able to do arithmetic (or algebra, or calculus, or geometry) quickly, everyone is fluent in their native language and has a strong grasp of the difference between what you can do with GoogleTranslate and what you can do as a fluent speaker. But the broader issue is that the task you wanted to accomplish (google ""used cars"", look at pictures of used cars) is pretty direct. Maybe it took you three times as long, or something, but not bad for such an obscure question. A search that is more efficient with contextual knowledge needs to be one where you don't know in advance what questions you might need to ask, either because (a) the questions will depend on answers to initial questions or (b) the question is more precise than what the search algorithm is good at locating. The ""Go"" example I chose because someone who has no contextual knowledge about go wouldn't be able to think of that strategy - not because he wouldn't think of using google translate or Wikipedia to find the word for Go in foreign languages if he wanted to know the word for Go in foreign languages , but because he wouldn't realize the foreign word would make a better search string. Alas, I can see you have never encountered this problem. The person having the problem never realizes the wifi ToS has anything to do with their problem. They may not realize they were connected to a wifi network with the ToS, or connected to the internet at all. When the app starts, Java automatically checks for updates for the app. The wifi network sees an attempt to access the network and sends you the html for the ToS page. Java interprets this response as an updated version of the app's data and writes the html over the actual data. There is no way to connect the two things if you don't know how they work - that java is checking for updates, that the ToS sends data for an html file to any application that uses the internet. Because of your whole spiel about how ""education is a staircase, we shouldn't make students start at the bottom when we have so many inventions that help you start partway up"", etc etc etc, I assumed your goal was actually for people to ascend the staircase. The ""diving board"" represents someone who has only just enough education to use a calculator or something similar, but nothing more; he climbs up his little staircase, but the staircase was only built so he could play in the pool. He isn't becoming educated. If your position is something like ""The dirty proletarians will all be baristas and janitors, they don't need any fancy book larnin',"" then I don't agree but I can see why many of my examples would affect you. If, on the other hand, you don't think most people will win the nobel prize but you do think most people should be educated to a level that would permit them to understand public policy and current events, pursue their academic interests, and aspire to a broad variety of professional paths, then (a) there are a large variety of applications where being able to translate a conceptual problem into an algebraic problem is important, and (b) there are harder and harder levels of math which rely on algebra just as heavily as algebra relies on arithmetic. The point of the example wasn't specifically about the relationship between the expression ""6x5"" and the conclusion that x=-15. It was that ""knowing how to solve 6x5=?"" is much broader than ""knowing how to input the string 6x5 into a calculator."" The first includes types of knowledge that aren't included in the second. More generally stated, knowing the answer to the question X is much broader than knowing how to input the string X' into a algorithm, where X' is the input for which the algorithm outputs the answer to X. Again, you wobble back and forth. First no one needs to know algebra; but now we need to educate people to make them creative! And how are they supposed to be creative if their quantitative thought is stunted at the second-grade level? Creativity means the capacity to look at the same problem in many different ways. Your view, however, is that if there is any problem that can be solved either by thinking in a certain way or with a tool, then only experts need to be able to think that way, and the proles will use the tool: and learning to think in as few ways as possible will make them more creative...?"
t3_2wwm6s,covr47l,"It's a strangely fun thing to imagine these sorts of situations, and I think it's actually quite healthy to do in some ways. It helps us imagine the greatest risks to our society, how we can improve our chances, and what we should be sincerely worried about. While humanity is - in general - experiencing a level of health, wealth, and stability that we really haven't experienced at any point in the past, this comes with its own set of problems. First off, we have never experienced the kind of population growth that we're experiencing today, and each person's lifestyle demands more resources from the earth than it ever has. So we have more people demanding more resources. That's the part where you start talking about food shortages as a result of population increase. To be sure, food is going to be a serious consideration in the future. However, with genetically modified organisms and advanced farming techniques our agricultural surpluses are the highest they've ever been, which is why we can sustain 7 billion people and counting. It's also important to remember that these advances often grow exponentially. As the population increases and more people are given access to education, our ability to create larger and larger agricultural surpluses tends to increase as well, as we have more minds working on these problems. It works dialectically. That said, the introduction of manmade climate change is going to be a new challenge. Previously fertile land will be made largely infertile. However , the growing periods in Northern regions are going to increase while this happens. Whether or not that will make up for the loss of agriculture in other regions isn't a certainty, but it's worth considering that climate change will affect different parts of the world differently. Nordic tundra areas might gain more farmland and freshwater. To be sure, freshwater will be an issue, with the rapid pace of technological advancement, more efficient means of cloud-seeding and desalination are not beyond our scope. As for the mention of nuclear war, that threat is diminishing consistently. War is a very different thing nowadays, and there is much less of it than there has ever been in our history. As a military tactic, well-respected commanders like Colin Powell have said nuclear weapons aren't particularly useful. Furthermore, despite what we may see in the news, the world is a much more stable place today than it really ever has been. Now, humanity never had the ability to wipe itself out until 70 years ago, so we really can't tell what will happen. However, war is not something that occurs internationally so much as intra-nationally nowadays, and paramilitary groups are not likely to use nuclear weapons in their own cities. A very important theory to consider here is called the ""21st century bottleneck."" This is essentially the idea that if society can hold it together through the 21st century, our population will stabilize at about 10 billion and stop increasing. That requires poor countries to continue getting richer, however, as populations tend to stabilize as people get richer."
t3_2wc5yt,copid03,"Do you believe that the same is true of other mountains as well, or just Everest in particular? If you are willing to acknowledge that there is ever a ""meaningful"" reason to climb any difficult mountain aside from ""because it is there,"" then I think you would have to allow for the possibility that someone could have a meaningful reason to do so on Everest, as it is simply another very high and difficult climb (and significantly less difficult and dangerous than many other peaks). I think it's important to remember that just because you find something distasteful, unpleasant, unappealing, or lacking in value, doesn't mean that it is inherently so. It just means you don't find it tasteful, pleasant, appealing or valuable. There are very likely activities you engage in that others would find disturbing or bothersome, but that doesn't mean that for you they aren't a source of satisfaction and meaning in your life. In terms of the Sherpas, I've actually done many years of work with indigenous populations in some of the absolute poorest places in the U.S. and I can tell you that while it may seem exploitative, for instance, for Native Americans to sell drums, pipe bags, feathers, and other trinkets to tourists (because it is both perpetuates misrepresentations of their actual culture and because it exploits and takes advantage of spiritual traditions which have already been significant casualties of war), surprisingly most of the people I've spoken to would still rather not have that small source of income disappear. I find myself wondering if this is not also the case (although arguably to a much greater degree) for those Sherpas who, if not for the income related to acting as guides, might find themselves displaced entirely, losing what is left of their way of life. Should they not at least be allowed the option about whether or not they choose to participate in a risky endeavor in order to preserve their way of life? Climbing Everest is still dangerous of course, but it's not as dangerous as it once was. It has gone from being an almost certain death sentence to something that is relatively safe, when compared to some of the other 8000 meter peaks. I haven't looked to see the recent statistics, so someone who has more time could probably quote them more accurately than I, but I believe we're talking about one death in hundreds of climbers as opposed to the initial years, during which it claimed virtually everyone who attempted it. In terms of the trash and waste left on the mountain. You're absolutely right. That is a travesty even for those of us who will never climb it and one that needs significant correction.

Nor does it mean that there are only two mutually exclusive options (that Everest must either not be climbed or it will be a dumping ground for trash and refuse). Other possible solutions exist that can address that problem without eliminating climbing the mountain as an option. The problem, of course, is that the measure of worth you ascribe to scaling the mountain is not necessarily reflective of it's actual value (which would be difficult to measure objectively, especially given that what drives each individual to do it might vary from individual to individual) and therefore weighing that against the damage to the mountain is not really possible. What I think we can agree on is that the damage to the mountain is unacceptable and that regardless of why people choose to climb it, this is the underlying issue, not the inherent worth of the activity. I'm uncomfortable with regulating people's choices simply because I don't see the value of those choices, but I think in this case the relevant factor is that people's individual choices are affecting something (the condition of the mountain) which belongs to more than just those who choose to climb it. I would argue however, that the preservation of the mountain and the experiences of the climbers can both be accomplished without assuming that only one or the other is possible."
t3_2vxtol,colviyq,"Circumcising culture and growing up circumcised tend to make people see the foreskin as a deformity rather than a normal part of the human penis. If you thought the foreskin looked like it was supposed to be there instead of thinking that penises are supposed to look circumcised, the circumcised penis might look like something painful happened to it. It takes weeks if not months for a penis to accumulate smegma. Myths about smegma are extremely exaggerated in circumcising cultures. This appears to be cultural defensiveness. The skin of the circumcised penis is often wrinklier unless the surgery made the skin very tight. The skin of the unmodified penis can be moved back to achieve a very similar aesthetic. For most penises, the skin stays back easily and retracts automatically with erection at least to some extent. Of course, this aesthetic argument shouldn't have any bearing on whether children's genitals should be modified without consent or any medical indication. The main argument against non-therapeutic circumcision is that the foreskin is a sensory structure of the penis that contributes a significant part of the feeling of the penis. Of course, I wouldn't expect it to change your opinion, but it's worth pointing out that in all cultures with cultural genital cuttings, a synthetic cultural aesthetic standard is applied to the appearance of the genitalia. The cultural idea that the penis should be destructively simplified to an uncomplicated rod is like the idea that the female genitalia should be surgically simplified however those cultures want it to be."

t3_2uj4yv,co9ncgk,"Apologies in advance for wall o' text: TL;DR @ the bottom Kind of divided. In general, I support the idea of more being on the states, but then you went and listed a bunch of things that pretty much have to be centralized. >abortion, voter IDs, healthcare, education, and taxation Starting with voter IDs and the most obvious: There are state and federal elections, federal being for president/VP ect. So federal jurisdiction will trump state laws regarding ID at polling places for these elections. It seems pretty silly and inefficient to have 2 sets of voting laws depending on the level of the election, so this doesn't work just for simplicity's sake. Not to mention, that until very recently, some states couldn't make certain changes to their voter rules, for good reason. Less than a day after that changed, they started trying to change it, allegedly to solve the problem of ""voter fraud"" which is so small an issue as to be negligible. Additionally, unless those states want to also provide those IDs free, or extremely , extremely cheap, it amounts to a poll tax (aka you must be this rich to exercise your democratic right to vote) which was kind of the reason they weren't allowed to change their rules in the first place. Phew, ok. 1 down. Taxation: We have federal expenses. Social security, medicare, paying our army, paying government workers, ect. So, the federal govt has to have an income stream, which we solve by taxation. This also has the effect of giving everyone a cash-based motivation to pay attention to federal policy, since you're paying for it. Second, this one is already split pretty effectively between state &amp; fed. I pay sales tax on most things I buy (Texas) that funds the state. So this one doesn't make sense either. Healthcare: Starting to get a little more controversial. To start off with, healthcare is such a big thing that it should be consistent. People with radically different health outcomes just because they live in X state is a pretty terrible idea. There needs to be a central authority/chain of command so that we have one set of rules instead of 50. Especially since healthcare can often involve very rapid deterioration and emergency care. This also ties in to interstate commerce. If I'm a traveling manager for a corporate chain, and my area crosses state lines, I'd like to know that the same rules and regs apply to my emergency care if I happen to get hit by a car in the next state over. Also, if you do state-level as the top for healthcare, you can get weird state run or subsidized/influenced insurance setups?HMOs. What if Texas and Louisiana are in another petty power struggle, and Louisiana decides that their hospitals won't take TexIcare anymore? Am I just screwed if I fall and break a leg leaving a lunch with a client in baton rogue? Petty inter-state power squabbles happen all the time, and healthcare is not something I'm comfortable with them dragging into that muck. Education: This definitely meets the constitutional challenge for federal control, though it does admittedly rely on SCOTUS principles. Having an educated populace is a compelling government interest. An educated populace is more informed on issues, and has more information to base decisions on, ect. Mandating certain (extremely minimal) rules towards obtaining that education is most effective way I can imagine that also maintains the least invasiveness. This is also mostly accomplished via grants/funding, so it's not like they're outright using force, just monetary incentives. Finally, abortion....this will be interesting. Again, on principle of judical review, Roe V Wade has this pretty dead to rights that the...well, right to bodily autonomy (but interestingly enough, NOT the right to decide when to become a parent) is a matter of legal fact. So already we have the fact that there must be some federal oversight in the case that states attempt to ban or unduly minimize access to abortion (here's lookin' @ you, Texas). TL;DR version All of these are issues in which, yes, states should (and often do) have a pretty significant degree of control over, however, they are also areas concerning fundamental rights or vital federal interest/needs, in which case federal law must supersede."

A better assertion is that watches are obsolete as independent tools; even this, however, fails to recognize the utility of analog watches in rough terrain and in the event of disasters."
t3_2u9e12,co6da0r,"Japan isn't massively reliant on American trade, so this would hurt the US more than it would hurt Japan, and thus they would likely just call the US's bluff. Although the US is a more important trade partner to Japan than Japan is to the US, Japan mostly imports fairly undifferentiated products from the US, like refined petroleum products, industrial minerals and chemicals and beef. These could easily be bought elsewhere. The US, however, imports highly differentiated products from Japan, like cars and consumer electronics."
t3_2tn8qu,co0jf5s,"I think it's a very simplistic idea that solving our issues comes down to having a smaller population. Most of our issues in the modern world are very multi-dimensional, and population is but a single factor. Pair that with the fact that URL , and the[ global population trend shows that there's more people in underdeveloped nations than first world countries](http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-world-population.aspx), and I don't think your solution would be the perfect answer you think it is. ___ #As direct responses to your categories, however: ##Global Warming/Ecological Impact: The fact that most of the world is not highly developed shows that a lot of this pollution comes not from a bigger population, but from more developed regions with higher population density."
t3_2t8798,cnwncif,"First and foremost, the US is the de facto ""world police force"", whether or not some countries actually want this or we can agree if it's a good thing. IMO, I'd rather see the US as the world police over some other countries. This means that the US is required to maintain power projection capabilities, which is expensive. URL is a breakdown of the US military budget, where you can get a better understanding of why it's so costly. You'll also notice that it's a 10% decreased from '12 to '13. Not bad. I'll hit the bigger ones. You'll see that the vast majority of the budget just goes to maintenance and personnel. Meaning that we're supplying people with jobs, training and other opportunity which is generally a good thing. Without such a large military you'd lose out on a lot of jobs and training opportunity. The Atomic Energy Defense is essentially what it costs to maintain our nuclear force. Our nuclear force is an important stabilizer, and keeps other nations in check. Procurement is good for industries that support the military. That's a lot of jobs employing the people who make, support and maintain stuff that gets sold to the military. Military investment in these industries also allows for cool tech to trickle into the regular consumer market. R&amp;D goes along the same lines as Procurement, in that we're investing in developing tech that will probably trickle into the consumer market someday and benefit us all. There are long lists of things that were invented for the military and now benefit you today. So, of all these things there's always room to make cuts, however a lot of these things are either directly or indirectly beneficial to the consumer sectors."
t3_2s8qu4,cnn8scl,"You see, this is why I dislike the word ""multiculturalism"". People throw it around, but nobody actually has any idea what it is. Let's start with what it is not. That's not strictly multiculturalism. Multiculturalism and relativism are based around the idea of tolerance, but tolerance was around long before those guys. The Mongols and the Romans and the Khalifat tolerated other cultures - as in, you could believe in whatever god you liked as long as you paid taxes. This is not dissimilar from the tolerance we see today, with more emphasis, however, on people being able to work together rather than successfully live apart, because certain economic realities since medieval and earlier times have changed."
