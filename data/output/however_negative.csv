t3_2qu6fg,cn9jqcy,"Your statement is generic so can be falsified with any example of something that is illegal and people get it less because of that and isn't more harmful than the banned product itself: - Guns in european cities - Explosives - Slaves - Child prostitution Making the above legal would create more problems than the current illegal situation. You used examples of things that turn our to be highly controversial, like abortion and some drugs, and in this case it has been the case that the ban has been more harmful than the product, however making this situation generic to ALL bans is a wrong extrapolation."
t3_2q5zwb,cn37hc6,"Um... Not sure what series you watched, but Asami is not a minor character. She's very clearly established as part of Legend of Korra's ""Team Avatar"". She was a main character in all 4 seasons, and had a boatload of 1:1 team up action with Korra in Season 3 in particular (remember when she busted them out of airship jail and then built them a new ride from the damaged parts?) I'm puzzled why you consider her ""seemingly minor"" while you don't seem to have a problem considering Mako an important character, even though his season 4 arc was pretty much a glorified baby sitting job for Prince Wu. I'm hearing alarm bells every time you use the word ""seemingly"" for some reason :) I don't understand what you're saying here at all. But you reiterate the notion again when you say: I don't understand at all the notion that Korra's relationship (however you choose to interpret it) in any way takes away from her strength or independence."

t3_2oihml,cmnj7aa,"yes, i'm using C's point of view, and that's why i use C's morality. moral values vary between one with another, so we can't really just use ""population's morality"" as the standard, unless the population has clear majority (if not unanimous) agreement on the particular issue. killing for example, is near unanimously seen as unjustified. even then there are some kind of killings that can be seen as justified, like death penalty. however, cheating is not as clear cut."
t3_2nzz4f,cmigugj,"It's almost impossible for a prosecutor to fail to get an indictment in a grand jury proceeding if that prosecutor has any shot at winning the trial. This serves as a threshold so that prosecutors with really weak cases won't bring them just to harass the defendant, etc. It's only a rubber stamp with valid-ish cases, and it serves to prevent the defendant from being dragged into court on cases with less merit than that. You said: >they don't fulfill their positive purpose (forcing the state to bring a good case) What are you basing that on? The fact that there are very few grand juries which don't return indictments? That is because winning a case is much more difficult and the prosecutor isn't supposed to bring an indictment unless he thinks he can win the case. If you think you can prove something beyond a reasonable doubt, you can almost certainly prove that there is probably cause. These are vastly different standards. My guess about the Ferguson situation was that the prosecutor didn't want to bring the indictment, because there was no chance at winning the case, but political pressure forced him to bring the indictment. After that, it seems like he intentionally threw the case to avoid being in a Zimmerman type situation where he was trying an unwinnable case on national TV and looking like an idiot. With that said, once he brought the indictment his duty demanded that he try his hardest to win, and so that seems like a violation of his duties. Cases with national media interest are the exception rather than the rule, however, and very few grand jury proceedings will suffer from this flaw."

t3_2nokg9,cmfgdsv,"Morality is not an objective perspective, thus telling someone their values are immoral for reasons beyond their social or philosophical conduct is somewhat disingenuous. If someone's morals are built one the idea of 'not causing violence' then despite the outcome of the situation, and the logic behind the final result; using violence to justify later non-violence can also be seen as immoral. One would usually argue that 'there is another way' to get to the final result. Also your argument on other's 'rely' on anyone for safety, is a very one sided thought. Whilst it is possible for individuals to 'feel safe' when certain empowered but trusted people lets say police invoke their morality on others lets say thieves as to obtain a sense of safety or justice. But how about the issue that there are places like ghettos where the majority of people feel quite safe with drugs and prostitutes on their streets, and the main reason for violence is because some morality police come by every so often and make their otherwise normal lifestyles dangerous and violent. Not everyone ASKS for safety to be provided for them (against their will mind you), and feel safe without arbitrary definitions of what safe should be. And in this case, the violence is only made worse by trying to remove it with or without violence... the morality of whether certain acts should be considered criminal. Despite being totally up for using violence myself, I can see and respect the idea of someone being a 'absolute pacifist' and don't think their immoral because they don't support someone else's effort to cause violence at all. Despite it being a good idea in the long run. A good example is an old dog: One one hand you have an old dog you love to death, however would rather not see die."
t3_2mnpdh,cm65r7g,"I am curious where you have gotten your information on Haidt. Was it from an interview or a TED talk or from one of his books or an actual article like The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail? Depending on what you were exposed to you may not have gotten a full picture. Haidt's more political neutral disgust item deals with a brother and sister who are fully aware of what is happening and they choose to have sex. This item is another one he bases his disgust principle off of which affects both conservatives and liberals, it is not just conservatives that only deal with an emotional reaction to disgust. Also, we are dealing in the realm of experimental social psychology, so I would hope you had proof that liberals are disgusted by the burning of books. It seems like your view is based primarily on what you think each category is like, however, you have no sources to promote your ideas, nor did you demonstrate your own study to provide evidence."
t3_2m34jb,cm0sbmk,"I think the problem is self-awareness, and you seem to already recognize this. There is a division between sexuality in humans, and sexuality in (most) other species. That is, sex and romance aren't the same thing. There are various benefits and drawbacks to various levels of sexual monogamy in species. Smaller, fast breeding species tend to have no monogamy. Species with long developmental times tend to have more monogamy. Both are valid tactics. Our closest biological relatives is an even split between Chimpanzees and Bonobos. Neither are sexually monogamous, and there's no compelling reason to believe that humans are biologically wired to be sexually monogamous either. You want to know if sexual biology prompts is to be promiscuous? Yes. There, you can go home now. The reason that that's not a satisfying answer is that sexual biology isn't all there is. Humans are self aware. We have psychology as well, and psychology is rooted in and can affect biology. With self-awareness, and group behavior, we gained social needs. Social needs affect a person's psychological state, which affects a person's physical well being. With sexual biology, mating is about reproduction. With humanity's self-aware group psychology, mating is about Love (read: affection, infatuation, respect, desire, security, safety, comfort, etc.. I'll be using Love (capitol) to refer to all these aspects of relationships at once). Love (psychology) trumps lust (sexuality) most of the time in with humans because most of the time societal interactions (psychology) are more important for humans in matters of health, prosperity, and reproduction than base biological needs. Other users have posted that there is no ""should"" in this case. That's not quite right. What we ""should"" do is what is most conducive (individually and as a species) to survival, health, happiness, and advancement. So while being sexually monogamous might not be optimal, being romantically monogamous can be. To generalize, females benefit from monogamy because it helps to guarantee that their child will be cared for. For males monogamy is beneficial because it helps guarantee that their children are genetically theirs. Females are disadvantaged by monogamy because they could potentially get better genes for their child while with a worse mate. Males are disadvantaged by monogamy because multiple partners means more children (which may potentially be taken care of for free by another man). That's the biology. Socially, however, both men and women benefit from monogamy."
t3_2lclza,cltkxlu,"While you do you raise a good point, it is much easier to know if you are getting food that comes from a killed animal ie. a non vegetarian meal, as opposed to knowing if your meat came from an ethically treated animal. Take free range chicken for example. A lot of the time those chickens are treated worse than regular chicken because there is less supervision http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/free-range-organic-meat-myth/ . So even if let's say 30 percent of the people coming to a burger restaurant ordered a burger that came from an ethically treated animal it doesn't mean that the animal was actually treated better than a normal one. If however you (and a whole bunch of other people) decided to only order a vegetarian meal then you can know for sure that no animals were killed in the making of your food As for ""Second, an individual not eating meat makes zero difference, almost."""
t3_2kkqbm,clm9hyb,"This is a huge exaggeration. Sure, there are plenty of chemical responses when you have a kid, but not any more than when you ride a roller coaster or go on a first date. You may be referring to mothers who finally have something exciting and worthwhile to do with their time and go overboard with facebook posts. This is not typical, usually parents just drag the kids around to do whatever they were going to do if they never had kids. (some age-restrictive activities ARE phased out, but this often coincides with maturing anyway) Like I said before, it's not that big of change, and nothing you couldn't experience without kids. There are plenty of nurses who clean up after others, and EMT's deal with even more. From a selfish point of view, this is true. Raising a child is the most economical use of resources you can possibly have. Generally speaking, you are creating a better version of yourself, not to mention you still contribute a little bit to society while raising a kid, but everything that kid does in the future is because of your efforts. As far as efficiency goes, Having kids is like having compound interest on everything you do, and it keeps adding up until the human race is extinct. Having a kid is not an easy way to ""get a high"", it IS however, extremely rewarding for the amount of effort put in."
t3_2kacra,cljqwum,"This is actually a fallacy. There are ZERO studies that show everyone makes the same. All studies show that women earn less.

t3_2k4hym,clhv3j1,"I certainly won't argue for chess being a sport, and golf has already been covered.

t3_2irrk7,cl52znp,"I think that people who are African-American or Asian-American don't identify themselves strictly as such. The African/Asian part is there to indicate their race, not to indicate their place in society. It isn't a title people use in place of nationality, it is something used to indicate race when necessary. For example, if a black American travels to another country, and someone asks him what his nationality is, he would most likely answer ""American"" rather than ""African American"". If that same black American were to go into a (US) hospital for a check up, and the sign in form asked him what race he was, he'd either write ""African American"" or ""Black"" because they're two words that describe the same thing. The reason people in the US say ""African American"" rather than ""Black Guy"" is because the latter is seen as politically incorrect. Some black people could take offense at being called black, similarly to how an Asian may take offense to being called yellow. ""African American"", however, is universally accepted as being the politically correct way to refer to someone of that race (as well as Asian American)."
t3_2ia3iy,cl0blaz,"Suppose you find something that interests you within one of those four disciplines. With this approach, you have forces pushing you to not spend any more time on that subject than absolutely necessary. However, these sorts of interests tend to drastically shape and define who you are- they're not things you want to ignore without thinking about it first. Recognize the tradeoff- rather than being an expert in one or two fields, you'll simply be competent in four. I did something similar myself (not to that extent, however), and as I went on to graduate school, there were many things that I wanted to do that I simply didn't have the experience for, because I spent my time becoming more well-rounded."
t3_2eqf4w,ck21hrp,"What happens to the animals that get liberated? You can't just release a bunch of dogs, cows, chickens, monkeys or mice into the nearest public park and expect them to survive. Their ""free"" lives will be short and painful. They might even pose a threat to humans or wildlife. Animal sanctuaries are an option, but these lack the funding and capacity to take in significant numbers of animals (they're also very loosely regulated, so conditions may not be much better than in the lab). Also, scientists are not torturers. The vast majority of scientists are very respectful towards research animals and seek to minimize pain and stress. The simple fact is that without animal research, we would be unable to develop new medicines. We'd be unable to study the brain and body. We'd be unable to explore promising new areas of science, like genetics. I'm an animal lover, and I believe that animal lives have value. However, human lives have more value. I have pet cats, so the idea of sewing their eyes shut disgusts me... however, I also recognize that the research provided valuable insights into brain development that couldn't have been accomplished any other way."
t3_2epkxz,ck1q92g,"You are probably acutely aware of various differences between males and females. Do you think being aware of them makes you a sexist?

t3_2d4iry,cjm7yyk,"You do understand what statutory rape is, and why the laws were instituted in the first place? Young minds are not fully developed, and the maturity level between say, a 25 yr old, and a 15 yr old is (should be) worlds apart. The law is in place to protect minors from being manipulated and exploited by adults. We're taught from a young age that adults are to be respected, obeyed. It is ingrained by the time we're a pre-teen. As such, it is that much easier for an adult to convince a minor to have sex in many cases. It's not overt, it's insidious. The issue is not teens consenting to sex with each other . So long as there is a less than 4 yr age difference, there is usually not an issue, legally. At least not one that would be prosecuted. Provided it is consensual, most jurisdictions don't allow for a minor to be tried as an adult under statutory rape laws (which are rarely titled such). ""Romeo &amp; Juliet"" laws have been instituted in some jurisdictions to protect minors in situations where both parties are under the age of consent. They're inapplicable, however, when one of them is in an authoritative position over the other, or in cases where the age spread is more than a specific number of years (generally 3)."
t3_2d45gd,cjm4puq,This just sounds like you want everything to move towards a fast food type restaurant but there are reasons why people don't like these and one is that being served by someone means you don't have 50 or 100 people all walking round the restaurant trying to get drinks and place their order. Do the people need to carry their food back? Do they have to line up to order and get a drink? It seems like it would be easier to just stay at home and cook rather than have to queue for however long it takes to get this done in a crowded restaurant.
t3_2cz5rq,cjkjx53,"I don't have a problem with your point about the benefit of HOA;s, but I do have a problem with your assertion that everyone should seek that benefit, and not because of taxes.

I don't want a home to make as large of a profit as possible by selling it, I want a home so that I can do what I want with it, whether that involves building a tree house in the back yard, or ripping out the lawn and replacing it with a very large garden that provides all my vegetable needs for half the year.

Of course there are going to be options available to her. If a man does not want a child, the onus is on him to prevent that happening, however he needs to."
t3_2b1rab,cj0zinx,"The first part of your post is hard to argue with. You like what you like...most people would not agree with you, but that shouldn't change what you enjoy. However, a fully cooked steak does not decrease the possibility of picking up a foodborne illness. The potentially infectious bacteria would be found on the surface of the steak, which is being cooked, and not on the inside. I think part of the ""stigma"" surrounding people who go out and order steaks well done is that they are paying a premium for an exceptionally good cut of meat, and then having it cooked so that this exceptionally good cut is indistinguishable from an ordinary cut from the grocery store. The better the quality of a steak, the more tender and flavorful it is. The more you cook a steak, the tougher it gets, and the more flavor is lost as the juices are cooked away. So...the reason servers may laugh when someone orders a steak well done is that the person is essentially wasting money at a steakhouse because they receive none of the benefits of the premium product they're purchasing. Seems kind of silly, doesn't it? Also, while agree that presentation is part of enjoying a meal at a restaurant, I would argue that once you have begun eating the presentation no longer matters. Whether you've got a rare steak ""bleeding"" on the plate, or mashed potatoes smeared all over and no longer in an neat pipetted floret, once you dig in the presentation is ruined anyways. I used to work at a steakhouse and never witnessed to be true, however, I could understand why this might happen."

t3_29mv5t,cimm4sj,"I agree with your view, broadly. But I want to point out an important distinction between being anti-abortion and being in favor of government prohibition of abortion. So an atheist person believes in fetal personhood (which I agree is certainly a tenable atheist belief). But they also observe that there are large numbers of reasonable people who do not believe in fetal personhood. As a libertarian, they accept that government enforcement of their clearly-not-universally-held view is an overreach. So by this argument, we start from the incredibly well supported observation that the question of the personhood of the fetus is far from a widely accepted moral truth. Government intervention on such contested moral issues is oppressive and anti-libertarian. An atheist libertarian could certainly be anti-abortion but what they couldn't be is in favor of government regulation to prohibit abortion. You don't believe in a right to abort, but you also do not believe there is a legitimate government power to prohibit abortion. Non prohibitive attempts to reduce abortion would be acceptable, however."
t3_298qie,ciipym4,"The only places I've visited which don't have queues are ones which deliberately try to cultivate a casual atmosphere. So it's not that the establishment thinks queueing is not a fairer and superior method of serving people, it's that they think it imposes formality which would be undesirable to their clientele. Take bars for example: bars don't have a ""please wait to be seated"" sign; they don't have cutlery set out on the tables; and yes, they don't have lineups at the bar. They want to have as few processes as they possibly can, because that's what their customers want. So in the end it's subjective: you probably don't think queues are onerous at all, so your bar experience wouldn't be diminished by waiting in one. For most other people, however, queues impose structure that they're deliberately trying to avoid by going to a ""fun"" place like a bar."
t3_295zr6,cihuma6,"I fail to see how the internet promotes insular thinking more than the ""real world"" does. Offline, people have their families, their friends, their coworkers, and that's about it. You can't change your family, you actively choose your friends (and most people don't really make new, life-long friends all that often), and the workplace is not usually an environment for political discourse. And if it is, chances are you're in a position surrounded by people who generally agree with you. So what is it about real life encounters that you think encourages open-mindedness and cohesion? Your explanation revolves mostly around a few unfortunate trends you've noticed that have occurred during the digital age, but you don't note how these trends would be improved by the abatement of the internet. Let's face it: people are, by nature, ideologically stubborn and emotionally charged. Many people are not willing to discuss matters of import with a truly open mind and diplomatic demeanor. Moreover, most people surround themselves with others who agree with them on fundamental issues, as that's a pretty standard factor for friendship and attraction. But now let me turn the tables here: no matter how many people upvote comments they agree with, join communities for their beliefs, ignore people of opposing beliefs, and reinforce their preexisting ideals through additional online encounters, they are still exposed to the entirety of the internet. They have, at their fingertips, the collective knowledge and ideologies of basically all humanity. They can absolutely choose to ignore opposing beliefs, but how is that at all different than what people did prior to the internet? I know you focus on how easier it is to ignore someone online than in real life, but what sort of interactions do you think transpired prior to the internet? People didn't gather every night in a public square to promote open discourse. They didn't wander from community to community, sampling their varying beliefs and adopting some for themselves. People did the same exact things as they do now, minus the internet. Now, however, people are at least exposed to multifarious beliefs, communities, and cultures."

t3_24v147,chbf3nm,"When I started getting into algebra, the school made me buy an expensive graphing calculator. The idea was that we could play with graphs/eqiations and see how they're related. Each year, through out middle school and high school, we were required to own one of these advanced calculators in order to get through the class, until I got to Calculus, the highest form of Math offered at our school. In this class we weren't allowed to have any calculators of any kind. It seemed backward to us at first, but once the class started, we realized that the calculators were a waste of time. The only thing we could type faster than we could do in our heads were calculus solvers, but using those would have kept us from gaining the intuition we were aiming to gain by taking the class. Compared to my gf, who never does head-math, I can usually figure out a solution to the problem faster than she can get out her phone and start typing, not because I'm smart, but because I don't depend on a ""quick fix"" to solve my problems for me.

t3_23o885,cgyyncp,"Giving money away always sounds like a nice idea until you stop and think about who you're giving it to and what they're doing with it. It's important to remember that a lot of the world's poorest countries are poor because they're terribly governed. Simply giving them money changes nothing and may actually make things worse because when you hand their government that cash , their government spends it on guns to keep the people from revolting. Food aid, equipment, anything... it can all be used to hold the people hostage. The only way to fix that is by throwing the government out. Of course there's no guarantee that the next bunch will be any different. Secondly, just because their government's official stance as far as the U.S. is concerned is friendly doesn't mean that everybody agrees with it. Countries regularly bomb the shit out of each other while simultaneously sending food , medicine, and water. Saudi Arabia is a good friend of the U.S. and we all know how well that worked out on 9/11. We also know who it was who paid for the Mujahadeen (sp?) in Afghanistan while they were at war with the USSR. There's no brownie point system or official karma that dictates who's going to attack who and why they're going to do it. The U.S. military is miles ahead of everybody and it's ONE of the reasons that nobody even considers a direct assault on the U.S. Know what the absolute best way to keep the peace is ? This is going to piss off every social justice 'warrior' in existence but good old fashioned capitalism. That's right, trade. Countries that make money off of each other don't tend to attack each other. Not always of course but as a rule they're not interested in killing the golden goose. Depends on what kind of history they have really. The U.S. acts as a global policeman whether anybody likes it or not. Granted, most people don't like it but if not America then it'll be somebody else. Truth be told I'd rather it was America than Russia or China but that's somewhat beside the point.

Now, it would be illogical as well to toss aside the emotional impact that ""seeing the body"" before it is buried. Some people can not pull apart the consciousness from the carbon based husk that now sits before them, and this provides them with closure they need to move on.

t3_22itbs,cgnaaux,"First, let me say that anarchism here is defined as the abolition of systems of social hierarchy. The state, private property, sexism, racism, anthopocentrism, homophobia. This is not a state, in fact, it is the antithesis of a state. A state, while you've defined it here as an entity that levies taxes, is better defined as an entity with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. This makes the state simultaneously cultural and material in nature - the legitimacy is the cultural aspect, and the force is material. Zoom out. In order for this conflict to exist between A and B, the presently existing manifestations of the state would have to have fallen, their legitimacy challenged, and their ability to coerce either abated or rendered ineffectual in one way or another. This likely would have happened via an empowered coalition of people deciding either to (1) ignore the state, reject its funds, push out its goons/cops/soldiers, and live autonomously in one region, like the Zapatistas, or (2) actively resist the state via outright warfare like the Black Army in Makhno's Ukraine. Either way, the cultural notion that, for example, the US government, pigs, and armies were anything other than gangs would be sufficiently debunked to get to the conflict you describe. In order to re-enter a state paradigm, this notion would have to re-emerge. This tends to happen in the form of fascist movements, which explains the historical importance of antifascist action among anarchists. In order to re-enter a state paradigm, coalition A would have to forcefully subdue coalition B. This means they would be the initiators of force. Any act to counter this force is self-defense, which is a crucial part of anarchist practice. If some government agent enters my home without a warrant and I shoot him, am I a personal state? Anarcho-pacifists argue that this is the case, that all violence is hierarchical. Most anarchists, however, are not pacifists, and would argue that such an act would not be oppressive - it would be just."
t3_217z08,cgam4in,"You are sacrificing potential long-term workers for those of an age that will only work for a determined amount of time (depending on what the age is they have to leave in your country). Your argument could be that, yes, I do that, but I hire men instead of women. The thing is that you're not doing that. You do still hire women above 50. Age comes with a lot of risks too, in fact, where I am there is more likely to be discrimination against age because it's 1. More expensive and 2. Health risks. You look at it in gender-wide risks. You see men and women of equal capabilities, and draw a picture that portrays it as if the only gender-specific risk is pregnancy and sexual harassment. First of all there's a problem in removing the victim out of the equation when it comes to sexual harassment. What would you say if I had a company that refused to hire men on the basis that it's a risk they will sexually harass my female employees? You're (figuratively) punishing potential female workers on the basis of something they can't even control, instead of looking towards the actual, and factual, controllable factor. * I also find it alarming that you're using such exaggarations in portraying your problem. It is not 2 years. It is less. And it's even a less amount that is paid leave. You hire a woman who works for you for the rest of her career. Let's say she starts at the age of 25 and then continues on to at least her 65th. That's 40 years minus the average amount of kids and the paid leave that it would require. You end up with only a little less than 40 (around 39 I guess?). And yet you would hire a woman above 50 that will, by these calculations stay for a mere 15 years + health risks. You are sacrificing stability out of a fear of taking a risk, that is not in my eyes an actual risk. What you have is a petty problem over something that, in the bigger pictures, is not that big of a difference. You overlook the fact that men and women are different in ways other than pregancy/not-pregancy and have avoided the opportunity of a varied, stable and strong workforce all for the sake of what is a minor problem in long run. I think it's obvious that this is not a logistic problems, however logical you may find it, but rather a moral one."

t3_1xauzj,cf9rnej,"When laws surrounding marriage were set up in America, gay marriage was not only unaccepted socially to a very large degree, but also not common, as many did not think to like someone of the same gender. Marriages are set up within the government to control ownership of property. There is no reason for them to be set up legally if the only thing one is worried about it marrying for love. So when these were set up, no one would think they were stopping someone from getting married, they were only stopping people for getting around the law. If a man was going to die and wanted to transfer his inheritance without paying a large sum of taxes then it would be simple to marry whomever he wanted his inheritance to go to. There would be no large transfer because everything would be in the other man's name, by marriage. This is a logical reason to prevent legal same sex marriage in a day and age where there was not a large interest from the public. I would like to say that I am all for same sex marriage, however you asked for a logical reason, and at one point in time there was one."
t3_1we5ye,cf1drrq,"I'll answer as a cyclist that has been hit by a car ... 99.9% of cycling safety on roads is about not getting hit by a car. Give this a read http://bicyclesafe.com/. In any situation where it is safer to ride in the center of the road lane I do so. This includes places where there is no bicycle lane, where the bicycle lane is obstructed, or when the bicycle lane is filled with debris (even just twigs and leaves and stuff can hide other, more dangerous things for my bicycle). Other times where it is safer to be in the center of a lane are when I'm approaching a stop sign of a red light. I always roll through 4 way stop signs where there are no other cars or pedestrians, but I also slow down and check multiple times. This is largely because people who might be behind me simply expect me to do so and the safest thing to do is be predictable. But also, stopping and starting are when I'm most likely to simply fall over (because of the specific pedals I use that mechanically fasten to my shoes). Falling over is much more dangerous than staying upright, so even though it is unlikely for me to fall, it is better to keep moving. I am extra cautious when it is a 2 way stop sign because a car I don't notice isn't going to be stopping for me. I rarely run red lights however."

t3_1vloic,cethv0j,"I take issue with your third premise, OP, on two counts. Firstly, I would argue that the majority of drunken drivers did not make an informed choice (re: ""even if they understand the risks"") to commit their particular crime. Secondly, well, this is a larger issue with your post. Societies restrict the behavior of individuals for a lot of reasons, not all of them good, but usually because those behaviors in some way infringe on the rights of others. Someone may want to drive drunk or enjoy drunken driving as a recreational activity. That doesn't validate the act of drunken driving, which is more likely to kill other drivers, pedestrians, bikers, etc. than sober driving. Similarly, to choose an extreme case, we restrict the ability of citizens to murder other citizens because we believe people have a right to live without being murdered. The desires of the murderer are irrelevant. A freedom to harm others has been removed, so that people are free to live with a greater likelihood of not being harmed. That's the balance a good law creates. You posit that ""You are equally free to choose to drive without drinking and driving laws. You may choose not to because it is less safe, but you are not coerced..."" I mean, technically, yes, but this is a little strange to see in a post whose main complaint is against intellectual dishonesty. No outside entity would be restricting me from driving in a drunken-driver-filled world, but saying 'You're free to make this choice that is more likely to kill you' does not strike me as a truly free choice. If I have a knife at your throat, OP, and am telling you to sign a contract or be killed, by your argument this would still be a free choice. I wouldn't be restricting your actions. You could still choose not to sign and subsequently die. I could still choose to go on the road and subsequently get hit by a drunken driver. It's all about what you define as a restriction, and for me, knowing that a given behavior carries a higher risk will usually restrict my actions, whether or not an external entity is imposing that restriction. I might go even further and say that in both cases, laws and no laws, that there is an external restriction. One restriction is a legal penalty, the other is an increased risk of death or injury. In one case, a formal entity is imposing it; in others, the state of the world is imposing it. In both cases, I am free to make a choice. I can break the law and drive drunk anyway. I can get on the road when I know it's unsafe. Neither the law nor common sense would actually prevent me from the free exercise of my will; they would, however, dictate the consequences of my choices."
t3_1vhh7b,ceso4j1,"To respond to your first paragraph, having soldiers work on construction projects is a distraction from the goal of them being trained and ready to fight. The more practice they get in war, the better they will be at it. It does not solve that problem. You can't guarantee that the military will be sufficient for this task. You'll just end up budgeting for roads as a subset of the military. I am also not saying that it is impossible at all, but it would require a huge legal overhaul. It's not easy to get the laws passed. Right now, not all roads are national or even state-managed. If you're saying that the national military should do this, that's the easiest battle won. However, that would only apply to national roads like interstates. I also don't even know how the national guard and state level work would even legally function. There would also have to be an entirely new authority system for working on local roads, though I suppose that is a bit easier.

t3_1ty0ux,ceckou4,"There are lots of people who are fat because they lack the willpower to eat less and exercise more. You're right about that. But there are many other reasons why people get fat. 1. Can't afford healthy food. If you have 2$ are you going to buy a head of lettuce or 2 mcdoubles? 2. Don't have access to healthy food. There are these food deserts where only fast food is available. 3. No time to plan or make food. So many Americans pride themselves on being ""workaholics"" like it's a good thing to work 80hours a week to live the dream. If you're working that much, plus commute, plus sleep, plus hygiene, where is the time to plan, shop for, and make healthy meals. 4. Misinformation. The diet/fitness industry preys on people who don't know how to or won't research. Most people who diet will end up putting on more weight than they lost after the diet ends. The only real way to lose weight is to permanently change your lifestyle so that calories in &lt; calories out but there isn't a lot of money in that. 5. Genetics/Disorders. A small amount of people who are overweight/obese have disorders that make it extremely hard to lose weight or to not gain weight. Then there are people whose genes put them at a disadvantage, sure plenty of people stay thin even if their body stores more fat than someone else but couple bad genes in addition to a lack in willpower or any of these other reasons and you have a recipe for disaster. Lastly, concentrating on overweight/obese is important. One thing that really surprised me however is that using the BMI definitions, being overweight did not correlate to a higher incidence of heart disease or cardiac problems when compared to normal weight."
t3_1tqttm,ceakm2y,"This is rather blatantly fallacious for a number of reasons. There are currently millions of vegetarians, so are you going to honestly propose to me that if every one of those individuals all of a sudden accepted your reasoning here and started eating meat again, that this would have no effect on demand? This is obviously untrue. What this also means is that the individual's effect on demand is not zero, because if it were zero, you would multiply the total number of vegetarians by zero to find what the effect would be if they all started eating meat, which is obviously not zero. So what it is actually accurate to say is that the effect of one individual is somewhat small. It is is an effect nonetheless though, and if you'd ever looked up the statistics on how many entire animals the average human eats in their lifetime, you'd realize that it is much larger than you probably think. There are a number of things wrong with this as well. The first being: since when do you take your cues for how to act appropriately from wild animals ? You know what, wild animals rape each other all the time. In light of this, am I now going to hear you argue that we should be fine with rape too, ""because animals do it""? This line of argument is an appeal to nature fallacy, because it acts like just because something is natural, it is good for us to do. We don't base our actions and standards on how wild animals act. The next problem is pretty much exactly what you said: animals are generally not moral agents because they don't have a conception of morality. We do however, so pointing to an amoral agent can do nothing to inform us, as moral agents, how we should act."

t3_1rgch2,cdn0d35,"Part of the reason these gradations are there is that it's hard to prove intent. The example you give is a decent one, but we have a notion of ""manslaughter"" for a reason. Someone that never intended even to injure someone but kills them (e.g. accidentally crashing into someone and killing them) is less of a danger to society than someone that intends to do it. Let's say a person hits someone with their car, and there's some reason to suspect that they did it intentionally. If you can prove it, great, but what if you can't? Should they get off scot-free because it was an ""accident""? No, and it's a hell of a lot easier to prove that they did kill someone than it is to prove they intended to. That said, a major purpose of the justice system in the U.S. does seem to be about retribution. If you believe that justice is only served if the perpetrator suffers as much as the victim, then I suppose your view might make sense. Many people, however, believe that the punishment is related to how dangerous the criminal is, rather than how much the victim is damaged."
t3_1r452i,cdjfd1i,"Equality is not a ""fundamental value of society."" Sure, we strive for equality in many aspects- we want everyone to be politically equal and we don't want to privilege groups arbitrarily (whites over blacks, for example). However, people are inherently unequal. A rich person has a lot more access to goods and services than a poor person. An educated person has more prestige and skills. An able-bodied person has more access in general and more opportunities than a paraplegic. Even if we could somehow construe a society where everyone started off as 'equal'- equal opportunities for wealth, education, happiness, whatever you want to value in a society, it's intrinsic to the idea of a capitalist society that some will rise above others. Some people will succeed and some will fail. As to the idea of healthcare, this is the ongoing debate: is healthcare improved by a capitalist free-market arrangement, or does it succeed as a communal right? Profit margin, as you put it, is a driving force towards innovation- people want to succeed, so they put forth their best effort to achieve newer and greater things. It's economic Darwinism- the strongest succeed and therefore survive, and the species advances and sustains itself as a whole. If you take out that profit, then what propels the creation of new services? Where does the desire to evolve come from? This is the principle idea behind any free-market society, and it does make sense . Problem: what happens to those that don't succeed? Whether by misfortune, laziness, lack of intelligence, or insufficient opportunity, a significant portion of the population doesn't prevail, and they get left by the wayside. Is this unethical? I'd argue yes, actually. It maybe 'slow down' the progress of society, but humanity and compassion must be placed above progression and advancement. There are certain sectors where free-market is necessary and I fully support, but healthcare, especially for a developed nation with the available funds and infrastructure, should be a basic human right. That, however, has very little to do with equality."

It is irrelevant what significance the protagonist or antagonist have to the narrative, the protagonist could be someone who just witnesses caos unfold and reacts to it, despite not having any influence of the situation.

Co-operative play gives both players 3 points (the ""Reward"", R), however, if one defects and the other co-operates, the defector gets 5 points (the ""Temptation"", T) and the co-operator 0 (the ""Sucker"", S)."
t3_1pdul1,cd1jphb,"I'm afraid you've not fully understood my post then. Given you are in situation A, you have described a situation where empathy is totally necessary - if you had never been empathic, you would be unable to accurately emulate it (or at least, it would be excessively difficult and require almost clinical situations, which is useless to assume will happen in reality). Therefore, you must NEED empathy. There is also no advantage to not having empathy in situation A either. Likewise, situation B simply does not exist. You have no way to know you will never interact with someone again unless you intend on killing them after the conversation is complete. The chance, however slim, to reencounter such a person is why humans have a system of trust."

Twice as much for no better care. Some may argue that our elective surgeries are better off but, realistically speaking, having a knee replacement within a week of deciding you want one is less important than going bankrupt from life-saving but routine care. Having an appendectomy can quickly escalate to nearly $100k in cost if you don't have adequate health insurance. Things will get better in the future because of Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs. If people don't have what they see as necessary, we'll get off of our asses and do something about it. It is, but mostly with the primary education system. Standardized tests instead of real world skills are important because it teaches you processes. Learning things hands on at a job is the best way to learn real world skills.

This should lead to refinement in counter strategies. Also it liberates victims to know they are not alone. Rationalizing an assault on you to fit in society is still a problem as it takes the assault of the radar of authorities/doctors. It's important to know that rape is very prevalent even in developed countries. Everyone should know that. 2. ""are afraid that a rapist may be right around the corner, their view of men in general is affected."" This is indeed an issue. ""or example, some women get scared whenever a big, tough man gets visually angry, when in fact said man may be very nonviolent, just frustrated. When men are nice to women and do them favours, it is seen as the man is just doing it to have sex, when in fact the man may just be a nice person. Many people believe that single men can't have friends who are female, because he will be too preoccupied trying to have sex with her."" These are socially constructed.

t3_1ki1zh,cbp5nt9,"The only reason this video is on the front page is because men feel truly oppressed by what they perceive to be a double standard that says they can't hit women even if they're being attacked. I may be wrong but I'm fairly sure this has been fairly well documented as a double standard, men are usually assumed to be the aggressors in most situations based on the harmful female stereotype that all women are fragile and powerless and the harmful male stereotype that all men are violent. I know I would be weary to hit a woman who hit me since I would perceive it as wrong, even though logically that makes no sense. This might not be about gender roles and just about justice porn (we even have a subreddit for it) which reddit loves like /u/BenIncognito points out, but you don't even have to agree with that. People wanting to see rules of gender roles being broken in justified situations doesn't seem like something that has lost sight of reality. I don't think so, right? The idea that there is a great deal of violence done to women is not mutually exclusive with the idea that when violence is done to men by women there is societal pressure to endure the abuse rather than to defend oneself. It would have been much cooler if the guy had somehow flipped the tables through a peaceful method, but I don't think the video supported violence as much as it supported self defense. The victim seems to try to ignore the violent assailant, and to resist the attacks but as the assailant continues to attack the victim, said victim choose to defend himself. It is an answer of violence with violence, but the video itself doesn't seem to promote violence. Now we may simply not have the full context of the situation and our assessment may be wrong but that would have more to do with lack of doing research on the video than our views of the video itself. I agree it's a bit silly when we cheer people on for violence, even if it is self defense, for giving us that cathartic self righteous feeling but that doesn't seem to have anything to do with gender roles. It seems to me however that you think this is ridiculous because you may still be attached to the perception that for some reason women are weaker or more fragile than men, which is a sexist assumption to make."
t3_1ke0w4,cbo5iau,"TLDR: Yeah, we could buy a small netbook, but why, when we already own computers (laptops, even), and the tablet or smartphone is so much more convenient? Smartphones aren't just for work, they're also for people who like power hungry apps like netflix and youtube. So even though they could make less powerful ones for work only, they still have to be powerful for those other users anyway. You get to use your little smartphone for work and home life, it's awesome! Personally, I use a simple Net10 phone, all it does is text, call, and accept a minute refill card number. Yeah, real fancy. But if I could afford a smartphone, I'd buy one, if I didn't already have a tablet (it was a gift). My mother barely knows how to use a TV or VCR (yeah, VCR), a programmable house phone except for using it like any old fashioned phone, hell, I mean, even on her cellphone, she inputs the numbers every time instead of using the contacts, even though my sister input every contact for her! :) I gave my mom my old laptop and it was sufficient for her needs, she learned it really, really quickly too, however a tablet is still much better for her."
t3_1k3fd5,cblb6qd,"""If I sleep around, I am a slut. If a man sleeps around, he is a stud."" The thing I see with this one is that I feel it goes deeper than just the amount of sex a person has. As others have pointed out in a comment, it appears that Men are generally attracted to women far more than Women are to men. This is probably one of the reasons why men are stereotypically known for having a higher Libido than women. This then gets to what I am trying to say, when a guy is complemented as being a 'stud', people complement what it takes to be a stud. the idea is that to be a stud you have to be good looking, charming, intelligent, maybe even successful. However, there are insults for a man who likes to sleep around, such as 'womanizer' and indirectly, 'chauvinistic'. Regarding a female being called a slut, is the opposite. The general consensus is that ""it's easy to be a slut"". A 'slut' doesn't need to have any good qualities that would allow for her to engage in intercourse, not even necessarily be physically attractive. However, I think the issue mainly comes when a woman, even with the best of personal qualities, is called a slut because she likes sex with multiple partners. I would say this is where the double standard comes in, and sadly, thats the way it is. Thankfully that is slowly dying out. ""Men have freedom of opportunity."" This is one of those problems that builds on itself. While it is true that originally it was looked down upon for a woman to pursue a degree in something such as engineering, things have actually turned around greatly in general. There are even universities that give out financial aid to females applying for such degrees (sometimes for anything in general). this is why there have been many cases of Females out numbering Males in lots of universities. As to what I was saying regarding the problem building on itself, you said ""I don't want to go in them, but I'm not sure if it's because of the societal view placed upon me, that I can not, or if it really is an independent choice. "", this is one reason why there are fewer women than there should be in engineering. Less women might just feed the stereotype that 'Engineering is for men!'. the more that stereotype gets feed, the less women, and so on and so forth. However, on a more optimistic side, the less that stereotype is fed the better chances women are to join. This is also something that is gaining momentum, not just engineering, but more and more women are pursuing careers with more work time. This brings me to another point regarding racism and any disadvantage one might have for not being white in the US. I have only lived in the US for six years, out of all the countries I have lived in, it has been one of the least racist. Me nor my family have ever felt disrespected nor have I heard many cases of such a thing happening. It's sad to hear about what happened to you and your family, but try not to think all of the US was like that, I would say a large majority of the US is not racist. If anything, I feel like the US does a lot to help out 'minorities'. One big example also comes for colleges, if you're a lower middle class white person then chances are you will not get much, if any, financial aid. However, if you are a minority then chances are you will get much more help. I'm an international student, I can have not the absolute best grades but if I apply internationally to the US I am much more likely to be noticed than if I was your 'average' white american male with the same grades. I agree with you on religious intolerance in the US, however it is sadly worse in a lot of other first world countries."

No. I put the mother's right to her body morally ahead of a fetus's right to life. As medical technology increases, the fetus's right to life will interfere less with the mother's right to her own body. I guess my phrasing is poor.

When Apple was close to bankrupt, Jony Ive worked for Apple but was a nobody. When Steve Jobs returned Jony Ive was given more and more responsibility because he was obviously a design genius. What about Pixar or Next? These two companies were touched by Steve Jobs and all of a sudden they were money making machines. Was that purely a coincidence? No. Steve Jobs had business insight and was the annoying perfectionist who knew better than others. You might ask: why does it matter whether he was a good businessman? Well, he wasn't just a good businessman, he was a good businessman and a good judge of products. (and that matters) He knew which to push for and which to dismiss and not invest in. One anecdote that comes to mind is when Steve Jobs got to see a finished iPhone. He was really mad at the touchscreen, which was made of plastic. He was absolutely adamant that regardless of the cost it needed to have a glass screen. The engineers told him it couldn't be done, but he said they would have to do it anyways. Then he got into contact with URL , who had an unused technology which they invented 25 years ago for a certain type of scratch resistant glass. Now look at us! Plastic touch screens have gone the way of the dodo and corning glass is now known mainly for their smartphone glass which is used in almost all smartphones and tablets. Lets talk about tablets. Did you know that Windows XP was a tablet OS? Perhaps you did know and proudly flaunt that fact whenever someone tries to say that Apple is so cool for inventing tablets. Anyways; the idea of tablets existed for many decades, and Microsoft made that idea a reality. You know what happened? They failed miserably. They failed so badly that when Apple brought out their tablet Microsoft was confident in the knowledge that people didn't want tablets. Windows tablets were big, heavy, and had a normal CPU architecture. They had the same interface as the normal XP and required use of a stylus. Finger usage of the touchscreen was next to impossible. Apple didn't invent the tablet, but they did make the first one people wanted. Microsoft knew that tablets were the future but they failed at realising them. The same with the iPhone. Apple didn't invent smartphones, but they did make one that was crazily different from everything else and which caused a massive shift in future smartphones. Ever since the iPhone smartphones have been all about touchscreens, apps, and simple to use finger interfaces. Before this wasn't even close to the case, and today you can't whip out a phone without a touchscreen and call it a smartphone. Do you know what happened the first time Apple tried to make a phone? They cooperated with Motorola in order to combine their strengths and make a good phone. URL Make no mistake about it, the ROKR was made by the same engineers who worked on the iphone. When they made the iphone however, Steve had a different mindset."

t3_1hmzrg,cavylue,"I will be responding to your amended opinion of a non-financial litmus test, and instead the test being a ""stable, crime-free, drug free home."" I'll first comment on the drug-free aspect of your view, since this is relatively straight-forward to accomplish. A simple urine test would accomplish nothing in this case, because it only requires being off drugs for a few days. Drug testing using hair would go back as far as 90 days. Given the average cost of $100 for a hair-based test, and the approximately 4,000,000 births each year we can assume that drug testing both mother and father for all the current births in the United States alone would cost approximately $800,000,000. It's prudent to note that this is based on the number of births each year, not the number of people attempting to get pregnant. As such, we can safely assume that the drug-testing program alone would cost the U.S. tax payers at least a billion dollars annually. Of course, you stated a drug-free home, meaning anyone that LIVED in the home would need to be tested for drugs (including current children) so that number is drastically understated. Moving on to your crime-free requirement. This would require a background check of all parties in the home, however we will use the same standard as above."
t3_1h9sqe,cas8g4g,"This is true, but only because Vim can be used in such a wide variety of ways. Getting everyone to agree on the 'one true configuration' is a pointless exercise. However, getting a decent set up is fairly easy if you just google around and look at some publicly posted vimrc's. You can always add and change things to make it more comfortable for your own use, but if you're against doing that then you're not going to have a good experience. I would go as far as to suggest you add a bind like map &lt;silent> &lt;leader>v :tabe! $MYVIMRC&lt;CR> which will make it very easy to edit your vimrc file just by hitting \v at pretty much any time. The reasons vim uses alternate keybinds is not only historical, it's also because its fast . Navigating and making edits in vim has the potential of being much much faster than in a regular editor. There is never any need to move your hands off the keyboard to click anything, most of the most common operations take just one or two keys. If I make a tyop during typing this paragraph, all I need to do is hit the following keys. &lt;esc>?tyo&lt;enter>cwtypo&lt;esc>A And then my typo is fixed and I'm editing where I last left off. I would bet money I can type that faster than you can move there manually either with the arrow keys or with the mouse. The motivation for not using the arrow keys is that it takes your hand away from the home row. Everything you need to do can be accomplished without ever needing to move your hand that far. Taking your hand off the home row is slower because you have move your hands over there, and because it's less precise. If you miss that particular keybind, you can just add something like this to your vimrc nnoremap &lt;C-s> :w&lt;cr> Like I said before, if you want to get the most out of vim you have to be comfortable changing it's settings to suit your style. Can you give an example? If you can see the place you want to move on the screen, you can type either the line number or the relative line distance between where you are and your target to get there much faster than you can move your hand to the mouse. Or you can jump straight there using `/` or `?` to search for the words around the text you want to jump to. Or you can use the `f` or `t` commands to jump to a given character. Or you can jump to a location you've bookmarked. Or you can use `{`, `}`, `[[` or `]]` to navigate by paragraphs. Or a number of other options. A skilled Vim user will have these movements in muscle memory. If you've only been at it two weeks, you haven't had time to build up the muscle memory to really make movement fast and intuitive. Are you just learning it on your own or are there people you know or work with that can give you tips and tricks? Have you watched any vimcasts URL about how to do things efficiently? Vim is not a general purpose text editor for the average joe, it's a specialized tool that is not intended to be dumbed down for beginners, it takes effort to make full use of it. If you haven't already, I urge you to read over URL This is true, but like I was just saying, vim is not a tool designed for user-friendliness, it's designed for raw efficiency. There is however extremely comprehensive help files, so if you want to know something you can usually type `:h &lt;topic>` and get some useful information."

t3_1gndd7,cam0we6,"Well the point of a P-zombie is that it isn't conscious, but doesn't necessarily have the same basic brain structure as a human. Then again, your response sounds like Daniel Dennett's, who argues that if such P-Zombies had no qualia, including the experience of pain, it would most certainly change their behavior and thus they wouldn't act identically to human beings. But I think the point of the thought experiment is that the zombie mimics human behavior perfectly, but doesn't have conscious qualia. Such a thing could be imagined, as run in a sufficiently advanced computer. If you had an android who looked human and could perfectly mimic human behavior without being conscious or having qualia, then wouldn't you say that philosophical zombies are not identical and thus subjective experience is part of what makes us human, thus providing a strong challenge to physicalism? Anyway, I guess I just sort of assume prototype theory when I discuss philosophy anyway. I mean, when I try to answer, ""What is art"" I don't think that I'm describing a strict classification that everything is either in or out of. I'm simply trying to understand what the term means by analyzing what is considered part of it and to what degree. Then, we can reconstruct a definition of what makes people think of something as art and thus try to understand what the term means, you know? Was that not articulate? It might not have been, so if it wasn't clear, I can try to explain it better. So I was reading Fear and Trembling by Soren Kierkegaard, and something he said really made me think about the nature of philosophy and doubt in the modern day, and I think it's quite relevant. Kierkegaard points out that reflection and doubt, unlike science, start over with every generation. No matter how reflective and introspective the previous generation was, unlike science, it gives no advantages to the current generation. The problem is that instead of starting from some kind of simplistic faith and having the great thinkers doubt and challenge accepted viewpoints, everybody these days starts with doubt. The issue is that we still associate this simplistic doubt with intelligence and thoughtfulness as if faith was still where everybody started and doubt is a major move. So this creates an awkward dynamic where everybody takes certain things as assumptions, but then claims that these assumptions are the result of scientific progress and doubting what is accepted. These assumptions, however, basically follow from the premises that lots of people accept, so they aren't the result of self-reflection and deep philosophical discourse."
t3_1fthzm,cadpyxu,"This one is actually pretty simple. If insurance companies couldn't discriminate based on things like age for drivers, they just wouldn't insure those higher risk groups. If they had to charge the same rate for 18 year old's as they did for 40 year old's, they would lose money on that age group. What's the point of being in the business of insuring people if you're going to lose money doing it? Insurance companies aren't charities. Even though you may individually be a good driver, there is no way for a company to ascertain that. All they can measure is the group's statistics, and unfortunately that's where your peer group screws you. One other point: there is nothing about blackness that says anything about whether you will be a criminal or not. There are things like poverty and lack of education (unfortunately related to being black in America) that influence criminality, and that's why you might say a black man has a statistically higher chance of committing a crime in certain areas. The cause isn't because a person is black or white though. Being young ,however, does have a direct impact on how good a driver you are likely to be though, due to the way the brain develops."

Why not have the attitude that they should go further, to press the relevance of their fields and actively advocate rather than shut up and get a real job? Some humanities majors are clueless and entitled, others chose to go against the advice of countless voices telling them how unrealistic their ambitions are. The thing is that no one makes it without support of some kind. Career recruiters are greasing the wheels for folks in STEM professions while writers, linguists, and anthropologists are told that no one really gets paid for that outside academia and nobody's funding anything aside from STEM in academia anymore. That's not a statement of what's possible, it's a statement of what our current society will support. Being frustrated about it and complaining that other people are responding to it ineffectively is armchair activism behind a veneer of cynicism. 'knowing better' doesn't make you wiser than the folks that just complain. If action is required, it makes you more culpable. Not that I'm saying that you are responsible for anybody's choices, but to some degree we are all responsible for the lack of viable choices for an entire generation of college grads. The social responsibly for that does not fall solely on the market. I find the 'I did my homework, now where's my allowance' attitude of many current college grads disturbing because it places them in the role of child to the 'dad' of the market. What you seem to be saying is that what they have done wrong is not obey the 'dad' of the market well enough. An entire generation of educated middle class kids are now in the same position as the working class and the poor, at the mercy of a hostile market. In a sense this is good. No one should have their prospects in life depend on the whims of the market and placing middle class youth in that position has the potential of putting the reality of our economy in perspective.

Another reason that people major in the humanities and social sciences is NOT because of a natural disability in physical sciences, or possibly even a natural dislike for the subjects. Post-Cold War America's trend of increasing demand for technological skills and better equipment has not changed, however, the government sponsored push for quality educational tactics and funding most definitely did."

I would, however, question the economic effects of losing the beef industry."
t3_1dmdji,c9rvfop,"Your opinion appears to be correct, but only if the concerned individual is truly and indubitably wrong, which is a rare thing. A great many things are up for speculation. In a world where your image of arguments would be true, there would be no place for ""meaningful conversation"". Argumented conversation is based on differing opinions, and differing opinions often stem from different sources, or no sources at all. Conversing can be one of the best ways to learn about a subject, because your views can be explained, shot down, (dis)proved, etc. Being 'ignorant' of a thing often shows in the beginning of a conversation and is fundamentally different to 'not being informed beyond the basics'. Ignorance indeed has no place in a proper discussion. Basics however are often the best things to start reasoning from since they open up pathways for logical reasoning and thinking."
t3_1dahpy,c9ohbfe,"Actions should be judged in terms of the happiness they provide to the person taking them, with consideration for the harm they might or do in fact cause to others. I, for example, do not get any personal enjoyment out of doing sudoku puzzles. But I cannot assert that sudoku puzzles are a reprehensible activity simply because they provide me no pleasure. They provide others great pleasure, and for that reason I must recognize that sudoku puzzles have value insofar as they make the people who enjoy them happy. The case is the same for the consumption of alcohol in a social and responsible context. Now, the fact that alcohol has effects on the body and the mind that can lead one to take actions that can harm others is a very fair point, and one that I wouldn't dispute. If your argument were only that drinking is a bad activity when pursued to the extent that one's judgment becomes irresponsibly impaired and harm to others becomes a strong possibility, I think you'd have a very strong case. The choice of others to drink because it makes them happy, however, even if they are capable of doing it responsibly and their choice to drink does not harm anyone else, is much more difficult to justify."

t3_1ayifp,c91y4yc,"Middle school is excluded in this. In middle school, relationships were not on my mind, and so I cannot attempt to provide a different perspective and its own set of points to make. Also, it started off small, but now my thumbs hurt. I'm sorry for the long read. I'm unsure if this counts as me challenging one or more points, but I feel that the following should be mentioned at the least. (Edit: I did end up trying to talk about all. Whoops.) Rational and logical thinking is not present in all of us. I'll agree with most of your points, sure, but in first world countries, where teenagers are free to explore their sexuality, and make mistakes at an early time. The following is anecdotal, and certainly unlikely: I have two separate individuals that have been in relationships for 5 and 6 years, beginning 11th and 10th grade, respectively. I look at my past, and I notice that I engaged in multiple meaningless endeavors. Would I repeat it again? Yes. I was taught, by going through my mistakes, that you can indeed be with people to fulfill sexual desires, and that it is okay to do so if both sides are in the same boat; and if not, things can get troublesome, and the situation should be avoided. I was also taught that love, to me, is something that requires a lot to be felt, and that saying it is a big step that shouldn't be hastened. My life has a long way to go, but I learned from my mistakes. You could've repeated your arguments time after time, and I still would have went through with what I did. This is because not all of us can disregard our emotions, our desires, and stick to logical points.Besides, we are not mentally devoted enough to fully be rational at that age, anyways! For your first point: What do you define as a relationship? Are all couples able to have a romantic outing every time? Are dates where you just hang out really bad? I've been through some hanging out dates, and these are a different kind, yes, but you are also sharing your time and life with whom you currently adore. I know I remember some of those times when I think back, and I absolutely enjoyed living them. Besides, constantly treating somebody to something new, or same old dinner, will just dilute the experience. I am aware hanging out is subject to the same point. If I didn't go through with them because it is superficial, I would have missed out on so much. Second point: I've blabbed before, on this (see above) but it comes down to the experience you gain, and the memories you will cherish as you get older. I love reminiscing about the fun I had with my previous girlfriends, and even though I don't talk to them, I know our thoughts will sometimes cross. As for their friends, it is something that should be made clear from the beginning, in my opinion. Some can handle keeping in touch, others can't. That doesn't mean, however, that you shouldn't pursue a relationship because you can't answer ""what's the point?"""
t3_1arnlm,c90957k,"I don't really think there are good reasons to believe in God. That seems like a pretty basic challenge here - if you can't establish that there is a God, the rest of it can't be rationally defended either. I get that that's not really what the topic is about, though. That aside, if she did exist, why would she make a world that by all appearances looks as if it behaves according to discernible natural laws? Why would she give us rationality and then forbid it's systematic application through science? If God does this, wouldn't that make her a deceiver? Some Christians find that characterization of their God unappealing, while your view would glorify a God who is at least as much of a trickster as the talking snake. Still others believe that what is vital about Christianity is not its claims about science, but the possible redemption from sin through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. If you believe in that, is it really an integral part of your faith that the earth is 6,000 years old? If your belief is based on faith in God and the Bible, though, what exactly could you find out that would change your view? I mean, you're not going to care about the science, right? Because it would be simple to point you to a biology/geology/physics textbook if that were the case. If you're seriously interested in engaging the arguments against your view, of which there are many, URL has many sourced replies to common creationist arguments. Continuing the discussion here would probably require you to just pick the arguments that you find most compelling to bring them up. If they are empirical claims, however, be prepared for replies from actual scientists."

t3_34dp1h,cqtpbha,"If you don't mind, im going to try and change your view by looking at some of the policies you mention (which, despite my disagreement, are legitimate policies) and by trying to explain some of the more structural issues with the party. So Nigel Farage is obviously a well worded and rather charismatic fella. His facial expressions and some of his behaviour make him look like a low-brow village idiot that lives in a pub but the reallity is that he's much more savy than that. One major problem is that while he might be described as an astute politician, the rest of his party is riddled with incompetent gaffe masters who have contributed heavily to the perception that the party is all about ""bashing queers, expelling foreigners and keeping england for the english just like old eunoch would have wanted"" Granted these party members and their gaffes (which are later condemned) have done a great deal to help UKIP get popularist support but those that aren't so keen on the more extreme manifestations of the party are, rightfully, terrified that Nigel has no chance of keeping them in check once they get into parliament. Now the policies: Getting out of the EU because it has a lot of regulations which put a hold on the UK

The EU does have a lot of regulations which the UK is held too, but all the countries in the EU are held to them too. Furthermore the UK most definitely does have a say  in these regulations, it's sort of what MEPs are there for. The UK pushed very hard to get into Europe in the past and it knew perfectly well what it was getting into because since it joined the european community it has also had  a say in EU regulations. so this is a facile argument because the EU does impose regulations on the UK, but the UK contributes to forming these regulations. London is very dirty people come from other countries and don't bother to learn english and 'sharia police'. London is not all that dirty mate, trust me, i've lived in naples, rome, berlin and paris. All those cities are a lot dirtier than london. People do bother to learn english, some don't learn as well as others but most learn a little bit. A lot of people speak perfect english but still frequent people with whom they have another common language and with them they speak that other language (yes even on public transport). As far as i know, most immigrants in London speak some english, the proportion who speak no english at all is very small and tends to be older people. Finally this ""sharia police"" it really isn't a thing. I've lived in an are that supposedly has Sharia patrols and i've never once seen anything, and i drink, smoke, loiter on the street way more than a city worker of my age should. As far as i can tell this whole sharia police thing is just a dozen uppity pre-teens and a whole lot of media hyperbole, like when that yank said that birmingham was a no go zone. Don't listen to that shit mate, and if you are going to listen to it, go see for yourself and judge for yourself, it's really nothing like what you would think. Lack of Tax on a minimum wage. I can't remember what minimum wage is but it is already the case that if you earn £10,000 a year or less you don't pay income tax. You only start paying income tax when you cross the £10k boundary. You do, however, IIRC pay NI contributions even when you are under the £10k mark."

t3_317c4q,cq08xc2,"YO time to clear up a history misconception. The Maginot Line WAS NOT a failure. In fact it did exactly what it was supposed to do. The point was to force the Germans to invade through Belgium, rather than have the war fought in France. In 1914, Alsace and France's most productive iron and coal production areas were conquered from the very beginning of the war. The Maginot Line insured this could not happen in 1940. The reason for the Allied defeat in the Battle of France was, infamously, the passage through the Ardennes of a German army and its breakthrough at Sedan, trapping the Belgian army, the BEF, and the best part of the French army near the coast. The Maginot Line, however, resisted all attacks, and actually many of the garrisons stubbornly refused to surrender even after the armistice."
t3_316pae,cpyu50o,"Your definition of ""better"" seems to be highly subjective based upon the metrics that you find valuable: Income equality
 Life expectancy * Education (test scores) * Environmentally responsible consumer habits * Mother's and children's rights * Nonviolence * Economic mobility * Inequailty-adjusted HDI etc. You say those are the measures of development for the US, but for lack of a better term, you ""cherry picked"" the statistics that define development based upon your subjective belief in their value, when there are so many others that can define development as well - not to mention, I'd argue quite a few people would disagree with your metrics as the defining measures of human development such as mother's and children's rights (which vary considerably even in Europe) and environmentally responsible consumer habits (for instance, Europe is far more reliant on foreign oil from the Middle East or Russia, all questionable regimes, than the US which gets most of its oil from Canada, Mexico, or domestically). Not to mention, quite a few of these metrics are debatable to begin with. For instance, education (test scores): aside from the fact that test scores between countries are considered only one of many metrics to measure actual educational performance/attainment, you're also ignoring the other metrics that paint the US in a far different light when it comes to education. As an example, the US dominates the top university rankings in the world, with a disproportional number of schools. You can see that quite clearly when you consider that the US has more international students than any other country in the world by a fair margin - URL go to the US for their studies. Proven to work? I'm not sure one can conclude that so quickly when there are social democracies in Europe that have serious problems today (I'm looking at you, Greece) that haven't been resolved for years. Not to mention, quite a few of those countries have only recently adopted social democracy and so the long-term impacts are only now being gauged. In addition, there are countries that are potentially ticking time bombs (like Spain). And if you recall, from the 2008 crisis, a lot of measures put in place were designed to fix the fact that European banks were even more overly-leveraged than US banks, an issue that may be compounded with growth problems in the future. The issue that a lot of economists are worried about is the low growth rate of a lot of the countries in Europe, something that might not be an issue a few years at a time, but something that will grow increasingly problematic in the future, especially as the center of the world economy shifts increasingly away from Europe and towards the rapidly growing economies in Asia and elsewhere in the developing world. A lot of what the US faced a few decades ago when it had the highest development in the world (and its cost of living far outstripped many others in the world) are also starting to show up in Europe. For instance, a lot of American corporations once outsourced work to Europe in places like Italy or Eastern Europe after the Cold War ended - but as the development levels in Europe has picked up and costs increased there, those jobs are being re-outsourced to cheaper countries in the world. In addition, Europe has a high rate of youth unemployment. Again, that might not be an immediate problem , but what if that continues for another 5-10 years? We're already complaining about the low growth rate, increasingly competitive and scarce job market - what will those currently unemployed 18-30 year olds be like if they continue to be doing if unemployed in 2020 or 2025? These issues compound - a year or two of low growth rate can be understandable. A decade of barely beating inflation, or even outright falling behind inflation? Everyone might be more economically equal today, but if everyone is getting poorer together, especially relative to the world, it is inevitably going to bring those rankings down in the long-term because worldwide development doesn't stop. Stop growing, however, and your development will stop as well."

When they use that hardware for remasters instead, it just proves to me that upgrading my console was completely pointless, as I have nothing new to play. If that argument fails, ask yourself a question: Does this game NEED a remaster? When you look at the game, it typically looks a lot nicer (About half the time), but does it PLAY any better? Did they add anything to that game other than graphics? If not, what's the point of playing it again, other than seeing a character's face modeled a tiny bit better? Sure, games like Grim Fandango are old enough to actually warrant a remake, but remasters for year old games are simply unacceptable. The game looks and plays almost identically to the last version. A third argument: There should at least be a discount for loyal fans. Example: I bought Last of Us in 2013 at launch. A year later, they release a superior version (however little) of the game."

But things such as the decline in glacial mass in the north and south poles appear to me at least to be evidence that it's not just stopping the environment from getting colder.
